<sect>Introduction

<sect1>About KTop<p>

KTop is the KDE Task Manager. It displays the processes running on
computer in list and tree form. Processes can be killed and various
other signals can be send to specific processes. It also features a
processor load and memory usage monitor.

<sect1> Authors<p>

KTop is currently developed and maintained by Chris Schl&auml;ger
<htmlurl url="mailto:cs@axys.de" name="cs@axys.de">. In the past several other people have worked on KTop:

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KTop
<p>
KTop is part of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KTop can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KTop, you need the KDE 1.x and Qt 1.4x.
All required libraries as well as KTop itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 

At the moment the following flavors of UNIX are supported:

<itemize>
<item> Linux 2.x <p> 
For KTop to work it is necessary to compile the
Linux-Kernel with the /proc-Filesystem enabled. This is the default
setting and most Linux-Distribution have it already.

</itemize>

Support for other platforms is in preparation. Your help is greatly
appreciated.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KTop on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KTop distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect1> Installing the Task Manager Icon/Performance Meter in the KDE panel <p>

It is possible to add the Task Manager to the panel. Simply use the
Start Menu/Panel/Add Application Menu to do so. If you have the xload
program installed you will see a performance history display instead
of the KTop icon. Clicking on the icon or performance meter will start
the Task Manager.

<sect>Using the KDE Task Manager
<p>

After you have started the Task Manager you will see a dialog box with
three pages. You can change to other pages by clicking on the handle
of the pages. The start-up page can be configured in the options
dialog available from the menu.

<sect1>The Process List Page<p>

The Process List Page gives you a list of processes on your
system. The list can be sorted by each column. Just press the left
mouse button over the head of the column. 

The list shows the following information about each process. Please note that not all properties are available on every operating system.

<itemize>

<item> <bf/PID/ The process ID. A unique number for each process.

<item> <bf/Name/ The name of the executable that started the process.

<item> <bf/User ID/ The login name of the user that started the process.

<item> <bf/CPU/ The processor load of the process in percent.

<item> <bf/Time/ The total computation time of the process so far.

<item> <bf/Prior./ The scheduling priority.

<item> <bf/Status/ The process status.

<item> <bf/Memory/ The total amount of memory (in kBytes) the process
uses. This includes shared memory.

<item> <bf/Resident/ The amount of physical memory (in kBytes) the
process uses.

<item> <bf/Shared/ The amount of memory (in kBytes) the process shares
with other processes.

</itemize>

Underneath the table you find four buttons which will be described now
from left to right.

<sect2> The Refresh Rate <p>

The refresh rate determines how often the process list will be
updated. This is particularly important for the calculation of the
processor load of each process. The load is averaged over the whole
time between updates. A slow, a medium and a fast update rate is
available. For most purposes the medium rate is a good compromise.

<sect2> The Process Filter <p>

The Process Filter can be used to reduce the number of processes
displayed in the table. You can filter out processes you are not
interested in. Currently you can display all processes, system
processes only, user processes only or your processes only.

<sect2> The Refresh Button <p>

This button can be used to force an immediate update of the process list.

<sect2> The Kill Button <p>

If you want to terminate a process you can send a kill signal to the
selected process by pressing this button.

<sect1>The Process Tree Page<p>

The Process Tree Page has been designed to show the relationships
between the running processes. A process that is started by another
process is called the child of that process. A tree is an elegant way
to show this parent-child relationship. The <sl/init/ process is the
ancester of all processes.

If you are not interested in the children of a particular process you
can click on the little box to the left of the parent and the subtree
will collapse. Another click on that box will unfold the subtree
again.

This page features four buttons to modifiy the tree. The buttons are described from left to right.

<sect2> The Sort Button <p>

This button determines the sorting order of the children in the tree.

<sect2> The Refresh Now Button <p>

The Refresh Now Button must be used to update the tree with the
current processes.

<sect2> The Change Root Button <p>

If you are only interested in a certain subtree you can selected the
parent of the subtree and push this button to make the selected
process the new root of the tree. Pressing this button when no process
is selected will restore the initial setting.

<sect2> The Kill Button <p>

If you want to terminate a process you can send a kill signal to the
selected process by pressing this button.

<sect1> The Performance Meter Page <p>

The Performance Meter Page provides two meters that show the overall
processor load and the total memory used by the system. The red line
in the memory history is the separation between physical memory (RAM)
and swap space memory. Most Unixes try to minimize the accesses to the
hard disk by caching files in memory. Therefore it is normal to always
have almost the whole physical memory in use. This is not necessarily
a sign of excessive memory use by certain programs but a sign of good
caching strategies. Due to the very misleading nature of this meter I
am planning to change it in one of the next versions to be more
meaningful.

<sect1> Pop-up Menus<p>

Clicking with the right mouse button on a process in the process list
or process tree will pop-up a little menu that allows you to send
certain signals to this process or change it's scheduling
priority. The latter is not available on all operating
systems. Changing the priority will affect the amount of CPU time the
process will receive to do it's job. As a normal user you can usually
only increase the value which will decrease the priority. The higher
the value the less likely the process will get CPU time. This can be
used on systems that are shared by many people. Longer running jobs
(batch jobs) should be "reniced" to preserve a short response time for
interactive processes.
