<P>KLJetTool is a program that lets you adjust your Hewlett Packard Laserjet
operating parameters. Some of Hewlet Packards printers such as the 5L or the
6L do no longer have a hardware control panel and the printer is controlled
completely by software. However this software is often available only for
the Windows platform. KLJetTool seeks to fill the need for such software
on the Unix platform. It should work with any printer that understands
Hewlet Packarts PJL ( Printer Job Language). However some features may
have no effect on your particular model.</P>
<P>I hope you will enjoy this little tool.</P>
