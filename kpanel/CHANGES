In kpanel-0.17:
 
    Patchlevel 5:
       - Changed pmenu to sort the items in the order of the text_names
         instead of the filenames as default.
         Also pmenu expects a sorted list of the real filenames in the
         "SortOrder" entry of the ".directory" file now for a user
         defined sort order.
	 This requires some changes to kmenuedit.
       - bugfix for occassional crashes with fast addding/removing of windows
    Patchlevel 4:
       - paints scaled minicions everywhere, even in the system menu.
         I thought this looks ugly, but Torben requested this feature :-)
       - empty "Personal" folder is ignored
       - weird taskbar bug (wrong window) fixed. Thanks to Stephan Kulow
         for bug hunting.
       - active taskbar button painted down (for Stephan Kulow :-)
       - Fix for qt-tooltips on taskbarbuttons
       - fix for big icons on panel buttons
    Patchlevel 3:
       - fixed the dragging of data onto panel buttons
       - no more need for the kdelnk suffix (but mimetype)
       - several small fixes
       - TaskbarPosition=top_left as default
    Patchlevel 2:
       - context menu improved/fixed
    Patchlevel 1:
       - Alt-F1 global shortcut for the system menu


==================kpanel-0.17 has been almost a rewrite============

Major visible changes:
    - no more graphical configuration (this is done by kcc)
       (not true, but will be removed soon)
    - works with the modern kwm II now (kwm >= 0.10)
    - uses Christoph Neerfeld's pmenu class from ktaskbar
      => item order can be modified via Chris' kmenuedit
    - works (only) with qt-1.3

Major unsibible changes: 
    - cleaner code :-)

====================================================================


since kpanel-0.16:

- visual feedback (waitCursor) when invoking applications via buttons.
- should ignore non-readable files and directories

NOTE: kpanel needs a kwm>=0.8pl15 now

- bugfixes
- no more special menufont
- handles general change requests from kdisplay now

- taskbar and windowlist sorted in virtual desktops
- virtual desktop definitions are yet in the global config file
   in a special "Desktops" group
- takes better care of kdisplay's settings

- tiny style improved (desktop buttons in one row)

- minor fixes

- small bug in minipanel's geometry fixed
- kwm like windowname detection
- fixed the taskbar look (didn't know it was broken... )
- kpanel:system (=kwm's Alt-F1) fixed

- PanelHidden refers only for a certain virtual desktop
- focusPolicy == NoFocus for all buttons
- minor fixes

- Desktop buttons editable (a really cool patch from Stephan Kulow :-)
- minor fixes to editable buttons (minipanel's desktopmenu, desktop
  changes via keyboard, FocusPolicy, ...)

since kpanel-0.15:

- standalone K-Button is also moveable now (with MMB)
- show/hide-state is saved
- Right positioning no longer valid
- Minipanel integrated (Sven and Matthias)
- RMB menu on taskbar (Sven and Matthias)

- several bugfixes

- first code for Sven Radej's Minipanel included.

- kpanel understands "hide" and "show" commands now (Sven Radej)
- implemented a new test-feature for the KDE-Button: Hide/Show Panel
   (doesn't yet work too well in combination with the taskbar)
- click on panel raises it   

- Bernd: Replaced usage of kfmclient by KFM ipc in 
  void kPanel::execute_kde_desktop_entry(const char* name) -- tool.C
  
- bugfixes in pixmaps handling

- RMB on taskbar will show the window on the current desktop
- fix to kwmcom (Christian Czezatke)

- works better with kdisplay --- also looks nicer
- fixes for drag'n'drop
- usage of KApplication::findFile() for icons (*./lib/pics/)
- usage of KApplication::kdedir()/apps for Desktop Entries
- empty-taskbar-bug fixed (division by zero)
- kpanel_version.h

- usage of KApplication::findFile() for icons (*./lib/pics/)
- usage of KApplication::kdedir()/apps for Desktop Entries
- empty-taskbar-bug fixed (division by zero)
- kpanel_version.h

since kpanel-0.14
- up to eight virtual desktop buttons 
- width of the desktop buttons as well as the number of buttons can be
   set interactively
- "--help" and "--version" command line option
- included KDE Desktop Entries contain "Type=Application" line

since kpanel-0.13

- reenabled my own tooltips for buttons, since qt-1.2 still has broken
   tooltips for windows that are WStyle_Tool or WStyle_NoBorder
- enabled my own tooltips for the taskbarbuttons, too
- several bugfixes and enhancements for tooltips
- compiles now with qt-1.2 (i.e. it includes X.h after qapp.h)
- contains a KDE Desktop Entry for kpanel now 



since kpanel-0.12
- fixed the reported segfault bug with kfm
- new config property "DateVisible". Can be "false"
- includes kpanelpics-0.3 (thanks to Mark :)
- configure and distribution stuff included
- contains a lsm-entry

since kpanel-0.11

- a patch for kwmcom and kwm-0.4.6 which makes
   swallowing possible WITHOUT breaking anything
   inside kwm :-)
- iconified windows displayed in brackets.
- taskbar buttons have full window title as tooltip
- taskbar buttons improved. I'm not too sure about the semantics, but
   the technical possiblity to put different actions on the different
   mouse buttons is implemented now. Yet the LMB just calls unMaximize,
   while the MMB toggles iconified/de-iconified. I'm open for ideas in this
   respect, if it's not something like weird jumping of the mouse-pointer ;-)

since kpanel-0.10

- menubar popups moved slightly to the right, they also cannot slide
  of the screen anymore (sorry, I just forgot about that)
- new look with flat buttons (according to Mark's proposal)
- several bugfixes


since kpanel-0.9
- icons can be switched during runtime from outside
- swallowing applications is possible

since kpanel-0.8

- reinstalled qt's tooltips for the buttons and modified kpanel's own
  tooltip mechanism for menus in a way that it looks like qt now.
  The menu tooltips can be disabled and appear with the RMB then.
- kpanel saves its state now after each change.
- support for the brandnew kwmcom_changed_window command.
- kpanel waits for kwm now to setup the communication.
- small bugfixes

since kpanel-0.7

- supports all kwm-0.4.2 commands (also kwmcom_define_maximize)
- taskbar highlights the active window (kwmcom_active_window)
- own tool-tip-like mechanism which displays the entries' info or
  comment field when moving over buttons or highlighting a certain
  menuitem.  (qtooltips removed)
- khome and ktrash shellscripts removed.  The KDE Desktop Entries
  "Home" and "Trash" now call the brandnew "kfmclient folder" function.
  Note that you need a patched kfmclient-0.5.5 for this to work (patch
  is included in the kpanel distribution)
- of course some unavoidable bugfixes. In fact kpanel-0.8 should be really
  stable now.

since kpanel-0.6.1
- bugfixes
- configure option implemented (not yet complete, but allows the
  setting of the location and the naming of the virtual desktops as well
  as the selection of several hardcoded design styles)
- new taskbar-location top_left
- buttons are yet left-aligned (pixmaps)
- buttons have tooltips (This does not work
  with qt-1.1, but maybe with qt-1.2) 

since kpanel-0.6
- bugfixes

since kpanel-0.5
- many bugfixes
- File System Standard
- make install 
- usage of kpanelpics-0.1 
- temporary scripts ktrash and khome
- simple taskbar-feature
                                              (Matthias)

since kpanel-0.4

- bugfixes (write/read-config should work correct now)
- usage of kwmclient as execution engine
- drag'n'drop onto buttons 
- drag'n'drop of kdelnk-files onto the panel
- ".kdelnk" extension yet necessary for compatibility with kfm
                                              (Matthias)

since kpanel-0.3
- some bugfixes, some internal improvements
- kwmcom stuff for communication with kwm
                                              (Matthias)

since kpanel-0.2.1:
- reads and writes its current state with kconfig
- reads properties [KDE Desktop Entries] Path and  PersonalPath
- is able to ignore ".kdelnk" extensions from KDE Desktop Entries to work
  best with kfm
- [KDE Directory Entry]  renamed to [KDE Desktop Entry] to be
  consitent with kfm
- Included various look-properties to allow a design similar to Mark's
  proposal as well as a look similar to the original kpanel.
- various bugfixes and restructuring 
                                              (Matthias)

since kpanel-0.2

- well... for some strange reasons the event-sending done in the
  eventfilter made trouble: At least on my machine the X-Server hangs..
  Sorry for that. After little rewriting the stuff works, but I didn't 
  really understand why this happend (sometimes)              

- kpanel is now a KApplication

- kpanel yet reads the Path property from the Icons-section as
  kfm does.

- kpanel yet understands the extended KDE Desktop Entry format 
   introduced by kfm-0.41, including the Terminal-Settings.

                                              (Matthias)
