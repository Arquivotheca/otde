Alpha Version 0.6.7

-------------------- ATTENTION ---------------- LATEST NEWS --------------------

KFM has a different setup procedure now. Read the installation instructions
below careful. No setupKFM anymore. On startup KFM will create everything
it needs. Before starting kfm the first time make shure that you dont have an
old ~/.kde/config/.kfmrc
Please delete it first!!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KDE Filemanager
===============

Features
--------

- Supports drag and drop.
- You can place icons on the desktop. Their position is stored. So when you
  start the filemanager the next time, all icons on the desktop will appear on
  the same position again.
- Double clicking with the left mouse button on a directory changes to
  the directory.
- Double clicking with the middle mouse button on a directory changes to
  the dirctory, but opens a new window.
- Right mouse button brings up a popup menu.
- You can assign some programs to every file extension. Doing so
  will place an item for every assigned program to the popup menu.
- Double clicking on a tar or tgz or tar.gz file will change
  in the tar file. Hust try it. You can even drag files out of the
  archive ( well, this may have some bugs).


TODO
----

Lots of work...

- better FTP support ( delete, chown, proxy ).
- passwords for HTTP
- Fixing bugs.
- Implement better DND. 


Needed Packages
---------------

khtmlw-0.5.4.tgz or greater
ktoolicons.tgz
kdehelp-0.4 or greater
libkde-0.8.tgz or greater
kfind-0.3.0.tgz or greater
Qt-1.2 or greater

Installation
------------
Just untar the sources and type the following:

./configure
make
make install

( this is done best at root, but it is not a must ).

I hope that I did not forget to include a file in the distribution.

FTP
---

You can now browse ftp servers. But it has many bugs. It just works with simple
servers like your local ftp server. A link to an ftp server is placed in the demo
file 'ftp.kdelnk'. Edit it to your needs and copy it to ~/Desktop. Whenever you
link a ftp file/directory to the local file system such a *.kdelnk file is
generated. Before compiling change user and passwrord in lines 1113 and 1104 in
file kio.cpp.


HTTP
----

I tried a little on this. Try it out with some easy HTML code.

Changes
-------

- This version has improved speed. It may have some new bugs since I had to change
  a lot in the HTMLWidget.

- Support for KSocket and KServerSocket is implemented. Look at ksock.cpp.

- DND bug fixed. Works now with AfterStep, too.

Verison 0.2a

- Faster HTML Widget

Version 0.32a

- Support for mounting filesystems.

- Fixed bug with root widgets.

Version 0.33a

- Basic FTP support.

Version 0.35a

- Lars maintaines the ftp part

- Fixed broken URLs using KURL ( and fixed this :-)

- Basic HTTP support

- Reads file .kde.html if found in a directory ( some extra tags )
  View the source directory of kfm with kfm to see what this means.

- Find Tool

- Mounts devices named in /etc/fstab
  Just enter 'default' as filetype and mounting will result in a call to
  for example "mount /dev/scd0". The corresponding lines in /etc/fstab might
  look like this:

    /dev/scd0       /cd                       iso9660         user,noauto,exec,ro 0 0
    /dev/fd0        /floppy                   msdos           user,noauto 0 0

- Many new options not worth mentioning here in detail.

- An "Location" Dialog like the one from Netscape to open an URL. This URL may
  be a normal file name, too, like /home/weis/test.html.

Version 0.36a

- Using libkdecore.
  You must first move kurl.cpp and kurl.h to the libkde source tree and recompile
  the library ( version 0.4 ) to fix some bugs there.
  Copy .kderc in your home directory for example. I think that the contents of
  this file is explaining itself. You can edit bindings and any kind of icons
  there. No need to change PICS_PATH in the sources any more. You must change
  the path in your .kderc file now. DONT FORGET!

Version 0.37a

- Using libkde-0.51

Version 0.38a

- Bookmarks ( Taken from Martin Jones Help System )

- Toolbar

Version 0.39a

- kfmwin.cpp and root.cpp have been restructured

- Root icons work like icons in a kfm window.

- Double clicking on icons will start the program

- Dragging files over an executable will start the program with
  the filenames or URLs as argument

- Dragging files over an folder will copy/move/link files in that
  folder.

- Extensions in .kderc may be bound to the beginning or end of a filename
  ^README will match all README files
  .html^ will match all HTML files
  xv will only match file named xv

- Applications may have icons
  You can define an icon for every application. This means an icon for
  the binary. It does not matter where the binary is placed.
  You must write for example

   [XV]
   Exec=/usr/bin/X11/xv %f
   Protocols=file;
   Extensions=Images;
   Icon=image.xpm
   Pattern=xv

- Templates
  Edit the directory for your templates in .kderc. You can store for example a
  default 'Makefile' or 'physics.lyx' or 'qt.cpp' or a complete directory there.
  You are offered to create a copy of these defaults in the actual directory
  when you choose "New" from the menu "File".
  If you put a directory in the templates dir, the whole directory is recursivly
  copied to the new location. You will be prompted for a new name.

Version 0.41a

- *.kdelnk files changes. They use the kpanel format now (KConfig!)

- Added support for kpanel like "[KDE Desktop Entry]" files.

	[KDE Desktop Entry]
	Exec=/usr/bin/X11/gimp %f
	Icon=draw.xpm
	TerminalOptions=
	Path=
	Terminal=0

- Addes IPC and client. In the subdirectory 'client' is a program which can be
  used to force kfm to do something. It may be used by kpanel for example
  to force KFM to open an URL or something like that. Start the program with
  no parameters to get help. The IPC was created using an IPC Compiler written
  by me. It is not public available now.

  You must type make in the subdirectory 'client' to create the program.

- Fixed millions of bugs and created new ones.

- Fixed support for *.kdelnk files of type LINK.
  A file looking like this

	[KDE Desktop Entry]
	URL=info:(cvs)
	Icon=draw.xpm
	Type=Link

  is a link into the net. In this case we have a link into the help system.
  A entry in .kderc like this

	[KInfoSystem]
	Protocols=info;man;
	Exec=/usr/local/bin/kdehelp "%u"
	Extensions=ALL;

  causes the kde-help-system to be used for displaying ALL files with a given
  protocoll. The Extension all must not be specified. It matches in this case
  all URLs with protocol info or man.

- You must insert this ( or something like that ) in your .kderc file.

	[Terminal]
	Terminal=/usr/X11/bin/kvt

  This is used to start terminal applications like pine from KFM.

- Preferences Dialog. Hitting the right mouse button and selecting the Properties 
  Menu will show you the dialog.
  *.kdelnk files of type LINK or the kpanel like files cause the properties
  dialog to insert a special page. It was never so easy edit a [KDE Desktop Entry]
  file.

- Addes DND root protocol. Other applications can make root drops and KFM
  will catch them. Wait for the next release of libkde to use this feature.

- KFM will work best in conjunction with kpanel in the future. For example it is
  a good idea to insert a call to
  
	/usr/local/bin/kfmclient refreshDesktop
  and
	/usr/local/bin/kfmclient openURL

  in the kpanel to work best with KFM.

  Matthias, use './kfmclient openURL /home/weis/Desktop/Trash' for example to open
  the trash directory.

Version 0.42a

- Find shows "No Match" if it found nothing.

- Seg. Fault. in properties dlg removed.

- Added 'openProperties' to IPC for kpanel. For example run kfm and call

	/usr/local/bin/kfmclient openProperties file:/root/2.jpg

  to open a properties dialog for this URL.

Version 0.5

- Supports '.directory' files used by kpanel. A sample .directory file may look like

	[KDE Desktop Entry]
	icon=draw.xpm

  All icons mentioned here must reside in the icon directory you mentioned in your
  .kderc file.
  In General you can find information about an directory in a .directory file. It is
  a simple KConfig file. You may add additional entries to those files.

- Uses new HTML Widget

Version 0.51

- Bugs fixed

- Exec stuff for KPanel. See kfmclient for information

- New installation procedure. Read the HTML docu for details

- Uses ktoolicons

- Works with .kfmrc instead of .kderc, too.

- Uses kdehelp

Version 0.54

- Is able to browse the WEB. But this is really pre alpha. Try it.

- kfmclient supports what Matthias wants to: kfmclient ask 100 100 url1 url2 dest

- applied Matthias patch and patched it since it crashed kfm pretty good :-)

- uses khtmlw-0.4.8 and libkde-0.6.3

- Root icons may be moved by few pixels now. Dropping an icon on itself does
  not harm any more.

- Installed little dnd print support ( still need printer icons ).

- Uses free icons ( I created some new ones but most of them are from Mark ).

- Lots of bug fixes and new bugs

- Deleting of non empty directories should work now. 

- Every Directory has a special properties page. There you can select
  its icon and its wallpaper. A set of free wallpapers is available.
  All Wallpapers install in $KDEDIR/lib/wallpapers

Version 0.55

- This version has a special way of dealinng with application and filetype bindings.
  Example application bindnigs are in $KDEDIR/apps/kfm. Every application has its own
  file with its own bindings. This means that deleting the applications *.kdelnk
  file will delete its bindings.

- Bindings to filetypes have some files in $KDEDIR/filetypes. Every file type has
  its own *.kdelnk file. Have a look at the installed applications.

- KFM has a statusbar right now. It tells you about the file you are currently
  pointing on and some information about the kind of file ( if available ).  

Version 0.56

- Browsing the Web and FTP sites does not popup many windows

- The toolbar has Office 97 look and feel

- Autostart folder is supported now. See docu for details

- extended documentation

- FTP supports passwords in URL like ftp://weis:secret@nowhere.com/

- The filebindigs use now simple wildcards as pattern like *.txt and README*.

- KFM does not open any window on startup.

Version 0.5.7

- Small icons in "Long View"

- Patch for KPanel included

- Makefile modified

Version 0.5.8

- Compiles with libkde-0.7.0

Version 0.5.9

- Bug fixes:
	- Selecting a directory and clicking on "New View"
	- "New->SomeFile" shows the new file in the window
	- "Long View" does not seg fault when doing FTP

- "Text View" works with FTP, too.

- "Text View" looks like "Long View", but no images are shown.

- Properties dialog for Applicatin-Bindings and File-Types.

- Runs only with libkde-0.7.1 or later

- You can copy/move/link files to the desktop

Version 0.6.1

- Tree Widget included

- Visual Schnauzer works ( can read/write xvpics ). It is XV compatible of course.

- File->Quit brings up a security dialog

- Copying(Moving a file to a place where a file of this name already exists, causes
  a dialog aking to for Overwrite/Overwrite All/Skip/Rename/Cancel.

- ~/Desktop/Trash has Trash-Icon by default

- Set of Filetype/Application bindings included. Most of them are taken from the
  kfind distribution. They are somewhat modified, so dont overwrite them with the
  kfind ones ( happens when installing kfind ). The Image.kdelnk does not
  exist anymore.

- Put the application KPanel->KFM->Refresh Desktop on the KPanel. Klicking on it
  refreshes the desktop icons and scans for new files on the desktop.

Version 0.6.2

- Works with Qt-1.2

- When changing filetype or application properties, the file manager is updated.
  No restart has to be done. If you changed the filetypes/apps outside KFM you
  may invoke "View->Rescan Binding" to update the file manager.

- Basic support for URLs with passwords. For example ftp://weis:localhost will
  work now, but it is still buggy.

- Stephan added a configure script

- kioslaves should die after kfm died. Please report any exception!!!

Version 0.6.3

- Changes in the makefile and the distribution

Version 0.6.4

- Fixed the bug with kfmslave ( now Matthias is perhaps a little bit less
  disappointed :-)

- Deleted kfmfind. Using kfind instead

- No more setupKFM. All done on startup if the files are not available

- Config file placed in ~/.kde/config/.kfmrc

Version 0.6.5

- New Root Icons are placed at a "nice location", not on the upper left corner
  of the screen

- kfmclient understands the command "sortDesktop". It arranges all icons on
  the desktop on a virtual grid. It can handle icons of any size.

- New app in $KDEDIR/apps/KFM. It is called "Arrange Icons" and just calls
  "kfmclient sortDesktop".

- Bugs in TAR mode fixed. TAR mode supports "long view" and "text view".

- "Open With" implemented ( thanks for the patch )

- Patch for ftp sites which dont want a password ( thanks for the patch, too )

- Icons appear under all existing windows.

- Included patch for drag.cpp in libkdecore. This works around a
  bug ( in kwm? ). When I delete the dndIcon and call XQueryTree, then
  I get BAD WINDOW errors. So I just moved the icon to -200, -200, called
  XQueryTree, checked not to send the icon a message and deleted the
  icon afterwards. The file contains lots of debug code. Please test it
  and tell me wether it works ok for you!

Version 0.6.6

- Applied patches from Matthias

- Fixed bug with .kfmrc

Version 0.6.7
