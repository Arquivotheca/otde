22.10.97, Torben

 - Added Henner's URL completion mode
 - Applied patch to kfmman's word wrap function ( Thanks to Paul Kendal )
 - Changed behaviour of "File->Run"
 - Added IconLoader to "class KFM", patches KfmProperties to work with this class
 - Added Henners patch for properties dialog. Permissions are now a joy to change :-)
 - Removed seg faulting when clicking on URL links on the desktop
 - Applied patch to make kfm compile on ALPHAS smoothly

30.11.97 Torben

 - Applied patch from Alessandro Mirone <alex@greco2.polytechnique.fr>
   It fixes problems with the size recognition of some ftp file.
 - Complete rewrite of root icon placing. Fixed many bugs. Now every icon
   is forced to fit into some grid.
 - Changed mounting stuff. Usual users can only edit the device entry in
   the properties dialog, the rest is ignored. Users may only issue
   commands like "mount <device>", that is why they are not asked for
   mount points etc. any more. If you are the root user, then everything
   stays the same
 - Added MP3 to magic file
 - Added static patch from Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to
   make things working on AIX
 - Added '-' to kfmsu2 to make it a login shell
 - In the properties dialog you can change the owner only if you are root.
   Everything else does not work anyway.
 - Applied patch from Henner Zeller <zeller@think.de> to allow editing of
   'kpanel swallow' stuff in *.kdelnk files
 - Added Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to the list of authors.
 - Directory Tree does now offer home_directory, desktop_dir and root
   in level 0
 - Items in directory tree are sorted now
 - If KFM calls other apps it uses for example 'file:/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/'
   instead of '/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/', but it still says '/home/weis/file'
   for local files without subprotocol
 - If files from the desktop are moved to the trash bin, then existing files
   in the trashcan are going to be overwritten wthout bothering the user first.
 - Tooltips on root icons
 - Changing the font will force the root icons to update => no more display errors

04.12.97 Torben

 - Warning dialog before rearrangig of icons is done
 - It should not be possible any more, to copy files or directories over themselves
   or a directory in one of its children ( at least I hope so :-)
 - Bernhard Leconte applyed some kfmprops layout patch
 - Password is deleted before we show the URL in some warning dialog.
   Before this patch, everyone could see your password if an error occured, ooops :-)
 - Added additional menu entries to directories on desktop. Now they have the same
   popup menus as directories in a KFM window
 - Icons in ~/.kde/share/icons do work as expected now ( they are displayed :-)
 - ftp://weis@localhost shows the home directory of user weis and
   ftp://weis@localhost/ shows the root directory now.
 - Links in tar files are recognized correctly
 - Fixed bug in kfmexec. Works with local files now, too.
 - Does detect fifos and socket disregegarding wether the 'x' flag is set or not.
   And it does not seg fault any more due to such a fifo/socket.
 - Fixed bug in history handling
 - Cache content is saved on exit and reloaded on startup of kfm
 - Extra menu for cache
 - Overview of files in cache is available now, in fact you can use kfm
   as a very cool offline browser now.
 - FTP can handle files with spaces and has no problems with UNIX file system links any more.
 - HTTP Header files "Host:" does now contain the port number is a special
   one is given.
 - You can enter directories in minicli now and KFM will open it
 - if untrusted pages ( http etc. ) contain links to the local file system,
   then a warning is displayed and the action is rejected.

15/12/97 David McCanney

 - Changed 'exit.xpm' to 'stop.xpm' in the menubar.  This was confusing some people
   (like me...)
 - Changed Help->Help... to Help->Help
 - Altered the Quit and Delete dialogs so the buttons go [Yes] [No] rather than
   [No] [Yes]  Everyone can stop moaning now :-p

17.12.97 Torben

 - Fixed bug in kioslave that caused tar:/ not to work on Alphas.
 - Now you can no longer delete the current directory. The entry is not any longer
   in the popup menu when you click on the background of a kfm window with the
   right mouse button
 - Popup menus do have pixmaps for the applications now. That looks really cool :-)
 - TreeView shows/hides dot files now
 - Clearing the cache works now

18.12.97 Stephan

 - applied patch by Piotr Roszatycki, that added klocale support and 
   accelerators to the property pages

04.01.98 Torben

 - Fixed bug in mounting. Please mention: NEVER put symlinks in fstab.
   This is a correct line:
     /dev/scd0       /cdrom  iso9660 ro,noauto,user,exec     0       0    
   but this one
     /dev/cdrom       /cdrom  iso9660 ro,noauto,user,exec     0       0    
   causes mount to fail on
     mount /dev/cdrom
   since it follows the symlink and can not find /dev/sdc0 in fstab.
   You may never the less enter /dev/cdrom in the KFM properties dialog.
 - Fixed bin in Device.kdelnk. Menu should now only contain one entry
   for mounting.
 - Fixed sprintf bug hopefully anywhere, to allow handling of URLs of any size.
   But not too well tested right now.
 - Applied patch for KURL Completion
 - Fixed bug in mounting dialog. The error message sometimes disappeared.
   Plese notice that some mount implementations are buggy. The do sometimes
   output error messages to stdout instead of stderr, which means that we do
   not catch this error messages.
 - Many small bug fixes
 - Patched KFM for "QString kdedir()". If I get the guy who did this .... grrrrr!!!
   Dragging multiple files to the tree view odes not crash KFM on my system now,
   since this dialog box does no longer appear while a drag is initialized.

06.01.97 Lars Hoss

 - Added dialog for proxy settings.
 - Modified KProtocolHTTP to read its proxy settings from kfmrc.
   The enviroment variable http_proxy is no longer used!

06.01.97 Stephan
 
 - replaced some << constructs with the new function ksprintf
 - fixed a bug in the passwd dialog

08.01.98 Torben

 - Fixed bug that causes seg. fault if one tries to delete multiple files.
   This was a VERY ugly one and should make kfm a lot more stable.
 - Spelling mistakes fixed.
 - Fixed hopefully all EINTR bugs
 - Deleting multiple files at once caused multiple updates of one directory.
 - Fixed geometry problem in user dialog

09.01.98 Stephan
  
  - use the Name field out of .kdelnk files or .directory files for entries
    on the desktop
  - copy a .directory file in the created Desktop directories

10.01.98 Stephan

  - take care of .directory, when calculating if Trash is empty

17.01.98 Torben

 - Fixed Stephans patch
 - Fixed bug in kfmprops that caused too long delays while opening the
   properties dialog. In fact it happend the same as in the above one.
 - Links on the desktop ( links in the unix sense of links ) are displayed
   italic now.
 - Fix for kfmsu2. The display is now set correctly, so KFM can connect to the
   correct one.
 - If you have a link on your desktop and open it, then KFM will use readlink
   to find the destination of the link. This is really needfull, since you
   want for example /home/pub/diplom/text.lyx instead of /home/weis/Desktop/diplom/text.lyx

22.01.98 Torben
 - Applied "KURL decoding patch" from Henner
 - Fixed empty root icon tooltip
 - Fixed bug in kioslave ( file=0L )
 - Uses UNIX domain sockets now => Communication is 99.99% secure.
   Now KFM should work without any loopback device, too.
 - Use fixed path in kfmsu2. Hardcoded to "/opt/kde". Change if required.
 - Fixed bug in recursive copy/move
 - Fixed memory leak in kiojob.cpp

25.01.98 Lars Hoss

  - Added support for NoProxyFor and FTP. Patched kioslave to work with the
    new Proxy Manager
   
12.02.98 Stephan
  - fixed the decoding of Directories, that caused directories named as "asds#sdasd" to
    be shown as permsission denied

14.02.98 Stephan
  - applied patch by Martin Jones, that fixes the text selection in HTML view

16.02.98 Torben
 - Fixed bug in icon arrangement ( icons should not disappear any more ).
 - Moved unix domain sockets tp /tmp
 - Runs "touch" on the sockets every hour to keep /tmp cleaner daemons away
   from our sockets.
 - Keyboard support: Cursor keys move among the icons ( IconView only ).
                     Space selects/deselects icon
                     Return opens document/directory
                     ESC open popup menu for icon
   Uses the key event handling in KHTMLW. Deleted QAccel in kfmgui

18.02.98 Stephan
  - I moved the decoding of path() into KURL and fixed some things concerning
    decoding/encoding.
    Note: I think, kfm still doesn't handle the whole URL issue good enough,
    but to change this, would mean to replace the const char* arguments with
    KURL arguments, I guess

03/04/98 Bernd
  - Introduced a bunch of configuration options: Colors, Fonts, Link Cursor
  - I love it! :-)
