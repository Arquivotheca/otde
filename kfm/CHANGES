22.10.97, Torben

 - Applied patch to kfmman's word wrap function ( Thanks to Paul Kendal )
 - Changed behaviour of "File->Run"
 - Added IconLoader to "class KFM", patches KfmProperties to work with this class

30.11.97 Torben

 - Applied patch from Alessandro Mirone <alex@greco2.polytechnique.fr>
   It fixes problems with the size recognition of some ftp file.
 - Complete rewrite of root icon placing. Fixed many bugs. Now every icon
   is forced to fit into some grid.
 - Changed mounting stuff. Usual users can only edit the device entry in
   the properties dialog, the rest is ignored. Users may only issue
   commands like "mount <device>", that is why they are not asked for
   mount points etc. any more. If you are the root user, then everything
   stays the same
 - Added MP3 to magic file
 - Added static patch from Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to
   make things working on AIX
 - Added '-' to kfmsu2 to make it a login shell
 - In the properties dialog you can change the owner only if you are root.
   Everything else does not work anyway.
 - Applied patch from Henner Zeller <zeller@think.de> to allow editing of
   'kpanel swallow' stuff in *.kdelnk files
 - Added Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to the list of authors.
 - Directory Tree does now offer home_directory, desktop_dir and root
   in level 0
 - Items in directory tree are sorted now
 - If KFM calls other apps it uses for example 'file:/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/'
   instead of '/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/', but it still says '/home/weis/file'
   for local files without subprotocol
 - If files from the desktop are moved to the trash bin, then existing files
   in the trashcan are going to be overwritten wthout bothering the user first.
 - Tooltips on root icons
 - Changing the font will force the root icons to update => no more display errors

04.12.97 Torben

 - Warning dialog before rearrangig of icons is done
 - It should not be possible any more, to copy files or directories over themselves
   or a directory in one of its children ( at least I hope so :-)
 - Bernhard Leconte applyed some kfmprops layout patch
 - Password is deleted before we show the URL in some warning dialog.
   Before this patch, everyone could see your password if an error occured, ooops :-)
 - Added additional menu entries to directories on desktop. Now they have the same
   popup menus as directories in a KFM window
 - Icons in ~/.kde/share/icons do work as expected now ( they are displayed :-)
 - ftp://weis@localhost shows the home directory of user weis and
   ftp://weis@localhost/ shows the root directory now.
 - Links in tar files are recognized correctly
 - Fixed bug in kfmexec. Works with local files now, too.
 - Does detect fifos and socket disregegarding wether the 'x' flag is set or not.
   And it does not seg fault any more due to such a fifo/socket.
 - Fixed bug in history handling
 - Cache content is saved on exit and reloaded on startup of kfm
 - Extra menu for cache
 - Overview of files in cache is available now, in fact you can use kfm
   as a very cool offline browser now.
 - FTP can handle files with spaces and has no problems with UNIX file system links any more.
 - HTTP Header files "Host:" does now contain the port number is a special
   one is given.
 - You can enter directories in minicli now and KFM will open it
 - if untrusted pages ( http etc. ) contain links to the local file system,
   then a warning is displayed and the action is rejected.

 - Changed 'exit.xpm' to 'stop.xpm' in the menubar.  This was confusing some people
   (like me...)
 - Changed Help->Help... to Help->Help
 - Altered the Quit and Delete dialogs so the buttons go [Yes] [No] rather than
   [No] [Yes]  Everyone can stop moaning now :-p

17.12.97 Torben

 - Fixed bug in kioslave that caused tar:/ not to work on Alphas.
 - Now you can no longer delete the current directory. The entry is not any longer
   in the popup menu when you click on the background of a kfm window with the
   right mouse button
 - Popup menus do have pixmaps for the applications now. That looks really cool :-)
 - TreeView shows/hides dot files now
