30.11.97 Torben

 - Applied patch from Alessandro Mirone <alex@greco2.polytechnique.fr>
   It fixes problems with the size recognition of some ftp file.
 - Complete rewrite of root icon placing. Fixed many bugs. Now every icon
   is forced to fit into some grid.
 - Changed mounting stuff. Usual users can only edit the device entry in
   the properties dialog, the rest is ignored. Users may only issue
   commands like "mount <device>", that is why they are not asked for
   mount points etc. any more. If you are the root user, then everything
   stays the same
 - Added MP3 to magic file
 - Added static patch from Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to
   make things working on AIX
 - Added '-' to kfmsu2 to make it a login shell
 - In the properties dialog you can change the owner only if you are root.
   Everything else does not work anyway.
 - Applied patch from Henner Zeller <zeller@think.de> to allow editing of
   'kpanel swallow' stuff in *.kdelnk files
 - Added Stefan Westerfeld <stefan@space.twc.de> to the list of authors.
 - Directory Tree does now offer home_directory, desktop_dir and root
   in level 0
 - Items in directory tree are sorted now
 - If KFM calls other apps it uses for example 'file:/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/'
   instead of '/home/weis/file.gz#gzip:/', but it still says '/home/weis/file'
   for local files without subprotocol
 - If files from the desktop are moved to the trash bin, then existing files
   in the trashcan are going to be overwritten wthout bothering the user first.
 - Tooltips on root icons
