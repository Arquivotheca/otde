TODO List
=========

- KFM seg faults on too large URLs. This might be a security bug
- Use UNIX domain sockets instead of internet name space sockets
  for more security.
- HTTP PUT command
- FTP does not always close every socket
* Configuration dialog for PROXY
* FTP Proxy
- Too many kioslaves on pages with many pictures
* Deleting of the cached data
* getting RAE files which contain spaces in their name are a problem.
- Opening the properties of a VERY large file causes very long delays
- Are tar directories really cached ? Does not look so yet.
* Changing from icon view to long view causes a reload.
- Writing directories in minicli does not cause KFM to open it.
