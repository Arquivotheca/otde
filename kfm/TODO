TODO List
=========

- KFM seg faults on too large URLs. This might be a security bug
  ( hopefully fixed but not tested )
- HTTP PUT command
- FTP does not always close every socket
  ( not seen in the last time )
- Too many kioslaves on pages with many pictures
- Are tar directories really cached ? Does not look so yet.
- Downloading files from ftp.troll.no does not work
  ( perhaps why they dont want to see a password )
- http://www.rhein-main.net looks broken
- Bug in recursive copying of directories
- Root Icons need italic font style if they are links
- KFM crashes if HTTP server closes connection unexpected.
- Support for netscape. Switch that allows netscape to handle
  HTML files
- index.html files of 0 bytes crash KFM ? ( not tested )
- kioslave crashes on dangling links if compiled with -O2 ( not tested )
- Kopieren von FTP server ?
- Links on FTP Servers do not seem to work
