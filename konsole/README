Konsole is an X terminal to replace kvt when it becomes mature enough.

I appeal for serious beta testing of this program. Please try your favorite
programs with it, and, if you are able to afford running beta software, use
it in your daily work, too.

Note that many KDE applications directly execute kvt. Since this is not
configurable, you might (cd $KDEDIR; mv kvt kvt.ori; ln -s konsole kvt)
to integrate konsole fully into the K Desktop Environment.

Before sending out any reports about broken or missing features, please
check the newest TODO and README.bugs. There are still a few loose ends.

Share and enjoy,
  Lars
