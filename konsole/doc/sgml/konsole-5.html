<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Bugs and FAQ</A></H2>

<P>Before sending bug reports, please check the problen with another
X terminal to find out whether it is `konsole' specific or not.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Application releated problems</A>
</H2>

<P>Some programs have flaws when run under a X console.
<P>
<H3>MC (midnight commander 4.1.21)</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> only when the emulation is called 'xterm' mc reacts on resize events
(before any key is pressed) and on (xterm) mouse events. Note that
xterm mouse events aren't specific at all, e.g. the Linux console
produces them also.
</LI>
<LI> After ^O (showing the secondary screen) mc does not propagate resize
events at all to it's sub shell. Try this with xterm, or whatever else
terminal emulation.
</LI>
<LI> Apparently it does more strange things with the sub shell.
When resizing the window with the mc panels shown, the secondary
screen gets somehow affected (by real or faked prompts). This gets
even worse when an application program is running while doing so.
</LI>
<LI> sends out at least newlines but often more stuff when resizing while
the panels are shown.
</LI>
<LI> Under high traffic, some parts of the text is known to get lost.
Try `ripple' in the test directory until you notice a drop. Since
i've been able to reproduce this bug with kvt, rxvt and xterm, and
i validated also that the data is already lost at read(3), i may
well have stumbled into something different here. Because i was
also only able to produce this effect while running mc, i feel
pretty certain that mc's subshell handling causes this effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>vim 4.6</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> emits a newline at exit, thereby producing a strange image on the
secondary screen when run together with mc as default editor.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>dselect (Debian package manager front end):</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> assumes black background. So turn to white-on-black color scheme
when using it.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Broken termcap and terminfo databases</A>
</H2>

<P>Please be aware of the fact that most applications (those using ncurses)
base their knowledge on how to talk to a terminal emulation on the 
information within a database. This might well be wrong. Again, you
should experience likely problems then with other emulations.
<P>So, for example:
<UL>
<LI>debian 1.3.1 (Bo) omits the kdch1 entry, thus the DELETE key does
appear not to work properly. Other keys might be missing as well.
</LI>
<LI>the mc 4.1.21 distribution contains a xterm.ti with faulty hpa, vpa
entries (with <CODE>[</CODE> omitted after <CODE>ESC</CODE>). Even stranger, xterm runs
happily with them, because of a feature, that allows to accept errorness
sequences under some circumstances (<CODE>ESC Pn C</CODE> is treated like 
<CODE>ESC [ Pn C</CODE>, where <CODE>C</CODE> is a non-digit.).
</LI>
<LI>I've included a xterm.ti for this reason. (Compile using tic.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Problems with BACKSPACE, DELETE and likely keyboard issues.</A>
</H2>

<P>Once upon a time there was a terminal without a delete key.
This problem has been perpetuated in Linux and is still a 
never ending nightmare. It has been worked around separately
in all programs that have to deal with these keys and they
have now ended up to be configurable and therefore are likely
to come in configured wrong. And so is konsole.
<P>Konsole emits DEL (0x7f) for the BS key and ESC[3&nbsp; for the
DEL key if the `BS sends DEL' option is activated, and then
behaves like a typically configured Linux console. Ctrl-H (0x08)
is then left for the use of the application programs, e.g. 
typically configured emacs help.
<P>When this options is not set, the BS key sends BS (0x08) and
the DEL key sends DEL (0x7f), as regular VT100s and IBM PCs do.
<P>[ Since every program can be configured BS=BS, DEL=DEL, and
the poor terminal without delete key mentioned above exists
today only in legends, the author wonders why this BS hack
is still around. ]
<P>ctrl-^ == ctrl-&nbsp; == ctrl-` == RS == 0x1e cannot be typed with
an european keyboard map loaded, since all three base characters
are prefixes (i.e. are eventually to be continued with a second 
character). X11 is known to have these dead keys.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Color Scheme and Font Attributes</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> The colors have been chosen to match VGA, that is the
appearance of the Linux character console. Therefore,
the colors are gamma-corrected a little and appear more
dim then the colors of xterm.
</LI>
<LI> Dark yellow is brown for the same reason.
</LI>
<LI> Apparently, not emulation used with Linux does carefully
distinguishes between the BOLD and the INTENSIVE attribute.
The later does not even exists. Thus, while bold means
intensive on VT100 terminals, it is treated as a font
attribute by xterm and rxvt. For strange reasons, both
applications really treat bold as meaning bold+intensive.
I found that looks weird, and hacked around it so that bold
means intensive for all but the default colors, which are
instead presented bold (and cannot be intensified).
Although the rendition function is well able to handle
bold and intensive separately, it appears that no agreed-on
escape codes exists, that could be used to take these two
orthogonal attributes apart. (I'm working on this.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Fonts</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> the VGA font uses a different encoding then the other ones,
and will therefore not display graphic and national characters
when run with TERM=xterm. It is best suited to dos(1) and
also work somewhat with TERM=linux. Note that the inclusion
of this font is experimental.
</LI>
<LI> other fonts but the ones included appear not to be usable for
terminal applications. This is not that much due to their
variable pitch (which i'd implemented experimentally), but
because they miss the graphical subset. Try xfd(1x) to check
this.
</LI>
<LI> In general a proper font family for terminals seems to be 
missing at all. If you know about a scalable terminal font
family, please drop me a line.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Security</A>
</H2>

<P>Although konsole is prepared to be installed root-suid, it is not
intended to be used so. Don't do it. Konsole drops privileges
immediately after being started. Secure keyboard is not implemented
and konsole does not fchown(2) the pseudo tty.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="probPack"></A> <A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 Problems compiling the distribution</A>
</H2>

<P>Due to the fact that this (and all other packages) are produced as
daily snapshots to provide you with the most actual developer's version,
you might well experience that konsole does not compile right out of
the box because a peer program or the package configuration material
itself is temporarily broken. Here is a workaround to compile konsole
in this cases:
<UL>
<LI>if configure works
<PRE>
  $ cd konsole
  $ make
  $ make install
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>if configure fails or you've downloaded konsole alone from cvs:
<PRE>
  $ cd konsole
  $ rm * (just keep the directories)
  $ mv config/var/Makefile.am.aside config/var/Makefile.am
  $ [evtl. remove (recursively) all CVS directories from config]
  $ cp config/var/Makefile.cvs .
  $ edit src/Makefile.am:
    change: TOPDIR=$(top_srcdir)/konsole
        to: TOPDIR=$(top_srcdir)
  $ make -f Makefile.cvs
  $ configure
  $ make
  $ make install
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.8">5.8 Known bugs (konsole-0.8.6)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> keys on the keypad does not cause any effect when numlock is not
set. This truly reflects, what i receive from Qt. All the keys
come in as #ffff. Think this comes from the eventFilter i had to
install to get the key-presses.
</LI>
<LI> The decision when to put lines into the history is sometimes not
ideal.
</LI>
<LI> check TODO for "bugs" due to missing features, also.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.9">5.9 Features that will not be implemented.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> utmp entries.
<P>The utmp is a database that reports who is currently logged on.
This is used by programs like who, finger, wall, talk, etc. to
list the users of a system and to contact them.
<P>It does not make sense when used with an X terminal, since there
is nothing like _the_ terminal then, to which one can send notices.
<P>The proper solution would be, to stamp the utmp with the xdm/kdm
session manager. Further, a proper notification/chat program should
be run automatically when the X session starts (ktalk?), so that
a communication channel is available to the one at the console.
</LI>
