   One might wonder about the complication of the license of Konsole
   and it's parts, so some explanation is needed for the ones who take
   care of this.

   Because QT (on which the whole KDE bases) is a non-GPL library a
   lot of concerns have been mentioned, one of them making Debian and
   others to stop distributing KDE. As a result of this, authors of other
   parts of KDE have moved to the Artistic License.

   Now since some of these authors might want to reuse the core parts
   of Konsole (and i encourage them to do so), i have formally to enable
   them by putting these parts under a different license (LGPL for
   these authors and an extra permission for Debian).
