                                 Rational


   One might wonder about the complication of the license of Konsole
   and it's parts, so some explanation is needed for the ones who take
   care of this.

   Because QT (on which the whole KDE bases) is a non-GPL library a
   lot of concerns have been mentioned, one of them making Debian and
   others to stop distributing KDE. As a result of this, authors of other
   parts of KDE have moved to the Artistic License. Since the Artistic
   License is too liberate for me (it allows to make proprietary software
   based on the work of the respective author), i do not go this road.
   Now since some of these authors might want to reuse the core parts
   of Konsole (and i encourage them to do so), i have formally to enable
   them by putting these parts under a different license (LGPL for
   these authors and an extra permission for Debian).

                      Can Linux dance with the wolf?
                      
                           A Personal Statement


   Having just changed the license of Konsole, i do not want to go back to
   work without expressing some personal thoughts about issues related to the
   whole process. Statements like this from KDE developers are rare and so
   are the discussions among them about it. These are my personal views.
   

   I do share some concerns of Debian, Red Hat, RMS and many others about the
   non-GPL-free foundation of KDE, although i see no real problem arising from
   it now or in future. That how-shall-we-deal-with-QT is not agreed upon
   throughout the free software movement is perhaps the biggest problem that
   we have with QT in the moment. To ease the minds of the many concerned,
   I'll port my KDE share to Harmony as soon as it becomes usable. I will not
   see advance in this, though, which will become clear if you read on.
   
   Troll has been going towards the free software community as far as any
   company i can think of can go without releasing their product under the
   GPL. They have to continue releasing their product under the current
   license. If not, it falls under GPL. Their source is open and free for
   freeware development. Practically, they have to incorporate our changes
   if they want to be part of the game. The only ones who have to pay Troll
   for QT are people who are making money from it. I think that's legitimate
   and fair, even seen through a looking glass.

   The KDE authors have carefully chosen QT both because of it's technical
   merits and it's liberate license, thereby raising a loan from a generous
   company, which is in fact unusual. Of cause one can worry about the cost
   of the debt and may feel angry about being included in the group of
   debtors without ever being asked. But i don't see it is so hard to say
   "Thank you, Troll". And yes, the price of freedom is courage. Ours and
   their's.

   Immanuel Kant stated freedom as pure independence, a basic border against
   the freedom of others. Hegel, who lived 50 years later, pointed out on the
   shortcomings of this idea (isolation), and found (quite typical for him)
   that freedom grows from mutual dependencies. How true. Living in Europa,
   i could tell about the dependencies of the separate countries becoming
   deeper over the the last centuries and how ridiculous tight our borders
   are today. Having spent the last nine month in the United States living a
   foreigner's life, i could tell about other borders to overcome. As a part
   of the free software movement, I'm concerned about the splendid isolation
   that this movement has from the commercial part of software production.

   While lately many important companies have made tries to get involved
   in our movement, the KDE project is currently the only attempt from our
   side. I see the QT dependency of KDE as an experiment and that Troll,
   the KDE developers, the Harmony programmers and any users of the KDE
   project taking their share of the risk in this process. It may fail, but
   knowing the involved groups, i hold this for being very unlikely. They
   all have individually the strength to handle the issue.

   To achieve a greater penetration of the way we want to produce and share
   our work into the corporate part of our particular trade, experiments
   like this are badly needed in my opinion. I have been writing to RMS and
   ask him to think about formulating a license that would still suit the
   needs of the free software movement and gives hint to companies that want
   to release their source for the use within the free software community.
   A delicate task for sure. May be he didn't understand my intention, but the
   outcome was, that he declined the necessity of such a license. So GNU does
   not head or guide these attempts, and it is left to individual software
   authors, companies and everyone else to deal with this fact.
   
   It is not true that the KDE authors do not take care for the freeware
   movement, especially including GNU. To the contrary, their effort has
   pushed the whole movement far forward from a state when moxfm and lesstif
   have been the only hopes of the desktop interested part of this it.

   Although I'm personally not addicted to harmony, i do not like to take
   part on the flame war related to the KDE and GNOME projects. But i do want
   to make Debian and others to become aware of the outcome of what they are
   doing to the KDE project by deciding not to distribute it.

   As said in the rational of the Konsole's license, many KDE developers
   felt being forced by Debian latest steps to release their work under the
   Artistic License, which is Debian- but not GNU-free. So the result of
   Debian's pushing is a loss for GNU. They may well continue to throw stones
   after the KDE project until they will finally have managed to build a wall.

   Talking politically, i want to express that a structural redesign is not
   only necessary when a program's task becomes larger and more advanced,
   but also when a movement grows and goes down it's road. Are we still able
   to integrate new parts or have we already reached our limits? Are we really
   compatible to the rest of the world? Are we loosing our identity by such
   an integration or are we loosing more then we gain? Does anyone outside
   have to give up their identity completely before they can take part on our
   game? 

   They're talking about "World Domination" in the Linux community, be it
   seriously of for fun. But can this mean anything different than to offer
   a true improvement over the current situation to everyone? Our particular
   trade tends to establish monopolies, and although companies never failed
   to do their part to get one, all minus one always suffered badly from this
   too, keeping themselves back behind their own possibilities. May be, the
   Linux way of making software can do it's share to find out of these
   troubles.
   
   Economically, there' many people out who want to make money from their
   work and publish their source to the benefit of everyone and themselves.
   RMS suggestion that program authors shall spend their lives from offering
   support for their products does not seem to work well, at least not as a
   first step. It apparently grabs to short. The only ones making their lives
   from freeware products now are some distributors. For me, this model appears
   as being too tight under the current circumstances.
   
   Troll work did not only overcome serious technical limitations in the X
   construction by kicking out the obsolete Xt component and replacing it with
   C++ which is far more suited to make new kinds of widgets, but they managed
   to get deeper into the free software movement that any software company did
   before.

   I wish we could match their abilities both in technical and political
   respect. I would love to see us all in a situation when parts of the
   corporate world depend likely on Linux as KDE depends on QT today.
   
   But playing with companies can be very dangerous. Most have a wolf's nature
   and forget their best intentions when they become hungry. And that happens
   to be periodically. The warnings not to do so are best founded. It certainly
   takes lots of skill and courage and likely much luck not to get hurt. It's a
   risk, but it can be a lot of fun also.

   Everyone in the Linux community wants companies being involved. The larger,
   the better. But now that this really happened many get scared when thinking
   about the possible consequences. Those who express their concerns cannot be
   be blamed to be cowards. A look on the research and development investments
   of the larger ones can really scare the bravest. And that's only their eyes
   but not their muscles and not their teeth.
 
   The relation between the freeware community and the corporate world is
   certainly a quest that will reappear in many forms, at least if Linux
   continues to grow. We have to solve each of them in a individual way.
   
   So how to deal with it? Can Linux dance with the wolf? With the bear? With
   the dragon? With the troll?


   Anyway, after this personal statement, i want to ask the distributors
   to seriously reconsider their KDE-related politics and to respect our
   programming effort as a true contribution to the free software movement.
   
   I can well live with the *political* decision not to distribute KDE. But
   i was very disappointed to learn that Debian did this with a poor legal
   reasoning. We have a culture of discussion to care for, too.
