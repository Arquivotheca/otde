From README-PROPAGANDA:

"  Propaganda tiles can be used freely, provided they are not bundled with
a product which violates the GPL. You can download them, use them wherever
you like, even give some to a friend. Thats fine -- But personally, my
thoughts are with the advancement of Linux as a platform. Propaganda is a
way to show the rest of the industry that Linux can be made _as good_ , if
not better than a certain unnamed Redmond,WA-based software giant's
"operating system". :) Its hoped that Propaganda will attract users to
Linux, and help current users at the same time."
