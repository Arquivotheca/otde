kedit+ 0.4.1
============

Solved the "tab" problem. kedit+ is now Makefile proof. :-)


kedit+ 0.4
==========

A few last minute changes to kedit+ 0.2 introduced an embarrassing bug,
which didn't let you "save as" an "Untitled" document. I fixed that
bug, and while I was at it I added colors to the Options dialog. 
Now you can also set the fore- and background colors of kedit+.
Martin Konold suggested I bump the version number to something larger
than 0.3.1 which was the last release of kedit.

If you have problems with the pixmaps, please note that you need
Qt 1.2 or better for kedit+.

Hope you will find this editor useful.

I STILL NEED AN OPEN-FOLDER ICON !!!! PLEAE HELP :-)

==================================================================
Readme for version 0.2:

This is kedit+ a simple text editor for the KDE project. I have taken 
Alex Sanda's kedit and turned it into what I believe to be
a useful little editor. I had to rewrite many parts of the original 
kedit and added, as you will surely notice, many new features.
Nevertheless, it is still no emacs and will never be one ;-)

I have tried to contact Alex, but haven't heard back from him.
Should kedit+ become kedit? kedit has not been developed for
about 4 month .... 


HELP WANTED:  I need an open-folder icon !!!

I hope you like kedit+, the next Generation :-)

     Kedit 0.3.1, small editor for the KDE project.
     
     
Kedit is a small, simple and almost featureless :) editor, just like
the well-known Notepad. It is suitable only for small editing tasks, or
as a simple textfile browser.

Currently, kedit is in a very early development stage. It can load,
save/saveas files, and - of course - it can edit those files :) There is
some room for improvements, but I really want this editor to be small and
simple.

Kedit can open multiple windows (so you can edit multiple files), without
having multiple copies of the whole program in memory.



Changes
=======

Version 0.3.1 (Martin Hartig, hartig@mathematik.uni-kl.de, 21.2.97)

- usage of the kdehelp browser, HTML help text added

Version 0.3 (Torben Weiss, weiss@kde.org, 4.2.97 )

- Drag and Drop added

- Added network access. Can load any file kfm can. To use this feature you
  must run kfm. If none is running kedit will start one on demand.

- Can save files everywhere kfm can, this means right now that you can
  write to ftp servers.

- Using libkdecore and libkfm. This means you need libkde-0.61 and
  kfm-0.51 or greater installed

- Fixed some bugs

- Works with any amount of windows now

- Changed some key bindings, but not all

- You can call
  make
  make install
 

TODO:
        Implement search again (and maybe replace), including regexp
        support. At the moment, only the search dialog has been implemented.

        Clean up some stuff, make it more user-friendly(tm).
        
	Keybindings: I'am sure, they are currently not kde-conform.
        
	Use (a not existing) KFileDialog that lets you enter URLs
