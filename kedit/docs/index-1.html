<P>KEdit is the default text editor for the KDE Desktop. It is a small editor best used
in conjunction with kfm for text and configuration file browsing. KEdit may also serve
well for composition of small plain text documents. It is not meant
to be a programmers editor, in particular it is not meant to replace any of the
more powerful editors such as XEmacs or Emacs. KEdit's functionality will intentionally
remain rather limited to ensure that KEdit will start  up reasonably fast.</P>
<P>I hope you will enjoy this editor,</P>
