<sect>Introduction

<p>
KEdit is the default text editor for the KDE Desktop. It is a small editor best used
in conjunction with kfm for text and configuration file browsing. KEdit may also serve
well for composition of small plain text documents. It is not meant
to be a programmers editor, in particular it is not meant to replace any of the
more powerful editors such as XEmacs or Emacs. KEdit's functionality will intentionally
remain rather limited to ensure that KEdit will start  up reasonably fast.
<p>
I hope you will enjoy this editor,
<p>

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KEdit
<p>
KEdit is a core application of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KEdit can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KEdit, you need the latest versions of <tt> libkdecore</tt>
and <tt> libkfm</tt>. All required libraries as well as KEdit itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KEdit on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KEdit distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KEdit uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>

KEdit is very simply to use. I am sure that if you have ever used a text edit you 
will have no problems with KEdit. 


<sect1>Editing files on the internet
<p>
You can open and save files transparently on the internet. Try the the following at the
command-line prompt to see an example of this.
