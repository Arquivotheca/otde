       README file for krootwm, the KDE root window manager
       =====================================================
 Developed and maintained by Matthias Ettrich (ettrich@kde.org)


krootwm is a tiny kwm module that handles mouse events on the root
window: root icon selection on the left mouse button, a windowlist on
the middle mouse button and a desktop context menu on the right mouse
button.

It is separated from the KDE window manger (kwm) to allow the users of
other windowmanger to get the full power of kfm. The only thing these
have to do is to comment out the ButtonPressMask and ButtonReleaseMask
in the XSelectInput call for the root window in the sources of their
favorite window manager. Then recompile, restart and start krootwm.

To be more detailed:

kwm for example contains the following code:

  XSelectInput(qt_xdisplay(), qt_xrootwin(), 
	       KeyPressMask |
	       // 		 ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask |
	       PropertyChangeMask |
	       ColormapChangeMask |
	       SubstructureRedirectMask |
	       SubstructureNotifyMask 
	       );

As you see, it does not select button events on the root window.  In
X11 only one client can select button events of a certain window. This
is natural, since a button press implies a pointer grab.


I will not support anybody in patching their windowmangers, since I
have enough to do with kwm. Anyway good luck :-)
