<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Frequently Asked Questions about kppp</A></H2>



<H3>I can't get kppp to work. kppp tells me that pppd has died! </H3>

<P>You didn't read the docs carefully. Here once more the most common
pitfalls.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Make sure that pppd is the actual pppd binary not a script
</LI>
<LI> Make sure that your /etc/ppp/options file exists, but is empty!
</LI>
<LI> Make sure that you DON'T use the options "lock" as an argument
for pppd (kppp is already taking care of device locking )</LI>
<LI> RedHat users: remove the "lock" option from your /etc/ppp/options 
file!
</LI>
<LI> Make sure you set the right permission. In case of trouble
you might want to run it as root first and then later, when
everyhing is working o.k give it less harmfull permission if you can not
afford to run kppp setuid root. The proper way to proceed would probably
be creating a "modem" group.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>kppp tells me ``Sorry, can't open the modem''.</H3>


<P>This means that kppp doesn't have permissions to open the modem
device or that you selected a modem device on the Modem Tab Dialog that is
not valid. First make sure you selected the right modem device. Once you are
sure you have selected the right modem device, you must 
give kppp the right permission to access the modem 
device and to be able to modify /etc/resolv.conf in case you want kppp to 
configure DNS correctly for you. If you can afford to run kppp setuid root
this would solve all access problems for you, if not you will have to figure
out what the right permissions are for your purposes. In order to give
kppp setuid root permissions do the following:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% su root
% chown root:root $(KDEDIR)/bin/kppp
% chmod +s $(KDEDIR)/bin/kppp
% exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>



<H3>kppp just sits there and waits: Expecting OK</H3>

<P>Have you played with the CR/LF setting?</P>



<H3>Can I do PAP and CHAP with kppp?</H3>

<P>Yes you can. Please the see the section on using 
<A HREF="kppp-8.html#PAP">PAP and CHAP</A> 
with kppp in the appendix.</P>


<H3>How do I write a telephone cost rules file?</H3>

<P>Just follow the TEMPLATE rules files supplied with kppp. You should be
able to find a copy in the <CODE>$(KDEDIR)/doc/HTML/kppp</CODE>. 
Use the -r kppp command line options to check the syntax of your proposed
rules file.</P>


<H3>I have written a telephone cost rules file for my region. Where can I submit it so that others can make use of it?</H3>

<P>I would love to receive any rule files written. I will make them available
on my kppp 
<A HREF="http://math.cornell.edu/~wuebben/kppp/kppp.html">web page</A>.
Before you send me a new rules file make sure it is not already available on 
the kppp web page. Then email the new rules file  to 
<A HREF="mailto:wuebben@math.cornell.edu">me</A>.</P>


<H3>My country observes a moving holiday different from easter.</H3>

<P>In that case you need to write new code that allows for the computation of that
holiday. Please have a look at ruleset.cpp and emulate the ``easter'' example.
Then send 
<A HREF="mailto:wuebben@math.cornell.edu">me</A> the patches.</P>
