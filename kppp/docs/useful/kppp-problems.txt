             I'd this problem too, solved it with adding pppd-default-options. I've 
             added:
                     -detach
                     modem
                     defaultroute
                     noipdefault
                     crtscts
                     name loki (loki is my machine)
                     user mweilguni (that's me)

             You'll need something like this if your /etc/ppp/options file does not
             contain these entries, otherwise pppd will die. So either put these in
             /etc/ppp/options or use the "Customize pppd Arguments" dialog from kppp.
             Beware, you may need additional/different settings.

             Hope I could help you.
