<P>kppp is a dialer and front end for pppd. It allows for interactive
script generation and network setup. It will automate the dialing in
process to your ISP while letting you conveniently monitor the entire
process. Once connected kppp will provide a rich set of statistics
and keep track of the time spent online for you. A build in terminal
and script generator will enable you to set up your connection with ease.
You will no longer need an additional terminal program such as seyon
or minicom to test and setup your connection. kppp features elaborate
phone cost accounting, which enables you to easily track you online
costs.
<P>
<P>I hope you will enjoy this dialer.
