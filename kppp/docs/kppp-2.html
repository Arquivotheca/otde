<P> <CODE> PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO READ THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS! THANK YOU! </CODE></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain Kppp</A></H2>

<P>Kppp is an application for the KDE project 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A>.
Kppp can be found on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/</A>, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A></H2>

<P>In order to successfully compile Kppp, you need the latest versions of <CODE> libkdecore</CODE>
and <CODE> libkdeui</CODE>. All required libraries as well as Kppp itself can be found
on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/</A>. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A></H2>


<P> <CODE> PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO READ THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS! THANK YOU! </CODE></P>

<P>I haven't been able to test kppp on anything else but Linux, but you should
be able to get pppd to work on a variety of platforms including but not
limited to SVR4, Solaris 2, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, SunOS 4, AIX 4, OSF/1 as long
as you have pppd installed on those systems.</P>

<P>If wish to compile kppp on a platform  different from Linux, please check briefly the
first couple of lines of  pppstats.cpp and make sure the defines and includes are O.K.
Most like however they should be fine. Please inform me of any necessary changes.</P>

<P>Kppp needs write permission to /etc/resolv.conf if you want to be able
to take advantage of its capability to let you specify the DNS addresses 
in the DNS dialog.</P>

<P>Make sure that the pppd's option file which usually resides in <CODE> /etc/ppp/</CODE>
exists, but is empty. pppd requires it to exist, but it must be empty otherwise
pppd will not take its options from kppp.</P>

<P>In order to compile and install Kppp on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the Kppp distribution:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
% chmod +s $(KDE)/bin/kppp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>Again:</B> Should you run into problems, please report them to me. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Preparing Your Linux System for a PPP Connection</A></H2>


<P> <CODE> PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO READ THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS! THANK YOU!</CODE></P>
<P>In order for kppp/pppd to work your kernel must have ppp support compiled in. If this is
not the case get yourself the latest version of 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/ppp/">pppd</A>
from any of the popular linux archives and recompile your kernel with ppp
support enabled. Don't fret since this sounds scarier than it actually is.
Don't forget to install pppd afterwards. If unsure whether you
have a kernel with ppp support issue <CODE>dmesg</CODE> at the command prompt
and look for something like this:</P>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>There were changes in the kernel PPP from Linux version 1.2.x to 2.0.x
which forced the programming of a new pppd daemon. In most distributions,
the pppd daemon can be found in <CODE>/usr/sbin</CODE>. For kernel versions 1.2.x, the
correct version of the pppd daemon is 2.1; for kernel versions 2.0.x, the
correct version is 2.2. or newer. If you don't know what version of the
pppd daemon your system has, you can type:</P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% pppd --version
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>None of the pppd daemons actually have a --version option, but putting
the option in will cause the pppd daemon to error out from a unrecognized
option and print out a list of options, which includes the version of the
pppd daemon. </P>
