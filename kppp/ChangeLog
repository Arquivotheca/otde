1998-09-21  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* introducing quickhelp
	* forgot to add i18n to quickhelp entries, fixed this

1998-09-20  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* PPP-arguments dialog reworked	

1998-09-19  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* more QuickHelp
	* began to clean up layout management, it's a mess
	* added setup widget for the throughput graph
	* some code cleanups

1998-09-16  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Added some more QuickHelp
	* The QLineEdit for fixed IP and netmask is not re-initialized
	with  "0.0.0.0" whenever you select "dynamic IP"
	* the scripting widget is disabled if authentication PAP or CHAP
	is selected
	
1998-09-15  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* replaced strings that span several lines with multiple
	strings, it seems that this was a GCC-only feature

1998-09-11  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* more code cleanups
	* fixed a bug in log.h (semicolon after a macro definition --
	brrr)
	* added quickhelp to many setup dialogs

1998-09-05  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* pppdata.cpp: fixed warnings
	* replaced readListConfig calls with calls to readWholeListConfig
	* and removed 'Whole' from function names afterwards
	* connect.cpp: sped up scripting loop by reducing calls to gpppdata

1998-08-29  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* In ConnectWidget::readtty(): after a newline or CR is received,
	the QSocketnotifier is disabled for 20ms to avoid reading too
	much, e.g. the start characters of the ppp protocol.
	* added compile option "NO_GRAPH" to disable the graph
	* removed the compile options "COMPILE_PIX" in pppstatsdlg.cpp,
	this is no longer needed or supported

1998-08-27  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* ppplog.cpp: use short named header file to keep Qt 1.33 users happy

1998-08-25  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* removed all QTimers for reading tty output, a QSocketNotifier is
	now used. Much better response time now, lower CPU usage!
	* "prompt" was deleted in the ConnectWidget destructor. Removed
	that
	* added telephone rule for Malaysia	

1998-08-24  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: re-enabled closeEvent()
        * pppdata.cpp: dumped writeListConfig(). Will do the same with
        readListConfig() too ... next week.

1998-08-22  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* some KDE style guide conformant changes
	* some code cleanups
	* removed -lkfile and -lkfm from Makefile.am
	* added debug switch to pppd command line when debugging
	is turned on
	* Improved the response time for modem output. Modem output is
	polled in longer intervals, if data is pending the polling time
	is shortened, otherwise the polling time is set back to it´s 
	original, rather high value
	* re-worked the "About" widget. It was time to save poor old Bernd
	from receiving bug-reports.
	* miniterm.cpp: code cleanups
	* improved responseness of MiniTerm, reduced CPU load
	* MiniTerm adheres to KDE Standards now (Help-Menu, ...)
	* The ATI query was broken. Fixed.
	* Improved the ATI query result window
	* modeminfo.cpp: code cleanups
	* main.cpp: code cleanup, banner updated
	* repaired the german "Tele-2" ruleset (was broken due to invalid
	characters)
	* added improved ruleset for Italy (thanks to Michele Manzato for
	supplying this ruleset)
	* fixed a few typos in the TEMPLATE
	* prepared a replacement for the debug-window
	* connwindow.cpp: code cleanups
	* began to remove the code dependencies between main.cpp
	(KPPPWidget) and the setup GUI components. This will help
	to separate the dialer and the setup later
	* general.cpp: code cleanups
	* accounts.cpp: removed as many references to p_kppp as possible,
	using signal/slots instead of. There´s only on occurence of p_kppp
	left
	* general.cpp: removed the mysterious function itoa (nowhere used)
	* various files: a lot of code cleanups, removed many references
	to extern variables, reduced the amount of functions called from
	p_kppp directly (done with signal/slots now)	
	* Added a new parser for modem speeds. The results are much better
	now, especially for the new K56flex/X2/V.90 modems (where
	different speeds are used for RX/TX)
	* removed tons of "#ifdef MY_DEBUG" and replaced them with
	functions "Debug", which is provided in log.cpp and is a
	"printf()" like function
	* added modem volume selector to the setup.
	
1998-08-21  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* use SIGINT instead of SIGHUP to end a connection
	* implemented command line option 'kppp -k' that will
	terminate a connection
	
1998-08-21  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Added a graphical display of the current modem line
	throughput.
	* Added an assistent for those "ppp has died" messages
	* Evaluating remote system messages now
	
1998-08-19  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>
	
	* added function to create a ppp - log
	* connect speed improvements

1998-08-18  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* fixed security leak in execute_command(): drop setgid root and
	close file descriptors

1998-08-17  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a bug in runtest.cpp that caused a segfault (fclose()
	called twice)

1998-08-17  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: added SIGHUP handler that will cleanly disconnect an
	existing connection.

1998-08-09  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* miniterm.cpp: switched to QMenuBar, fixed memory leak

1998-08-08  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* modem.cpp: fixed hangup that occured if the modem power was off.
	hangup() aborts after 2 seconds if it doesn't suceed. 

1998-08-06  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* runtests.cpp: scan up to 100 lines when searching for the
	unwanted 'lock' in /etc/ppp/options and recognize the '#' sign
	to avoid a false alarm
	
1998-08-04  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed replacement for systems without a BSD 4.2 style usleep()
	* modem.cpp: continued to move modem related stuff to modem.cpp.
	The new Modem class is inherited by the Connect-, MiniTerm- and
	ATI-Query Widget for now. This should be way easier to maintain and
	will reduce the binary's size.
	* modeminfo.cpp: cleaned up  
	
1998-08-02  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* opentty(): fixed XON/XOFF flow control
	* closetty(): flush data not read or transmitted
	* main.cpp: enforce killpppd()
	* modem.cpp: moved lockdevice(), unlockdevice() and modemspeed()
	into this newly created file. opentty(), closetty() and hangup()
	should follow soon to let them be shared between widgets.

1998-07-30  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: take the burden of specifying the modem lock file
	from the user. Just entering the directory should be easier and
	safer. Presets for different systems can be found in kpppconfig.h 

1998-07-29  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* macros.h: replaced remaining MAX with QMAX
	* main.cpp: followed recommendation of the Unix Programming FAQ to
	use _exit() instead of exit() in child processes  

1998-07-25  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: rewrote check for stale lock files. After dropping
	the use of /proc it should work on other platforms now, too.

1998-07-19  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* merged killppp() and terminatepppd() in killpppd()	
	* main.cpp: added execute_command() to launch external programms
	* added "Command Before Disconnect" for people who have to clean
	up before they leave the net

1998-07-11  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: replaced ~/.kde with kdelocaldir() 
	* connect.cpp: hardcoded ´-detach´ as pppd argument

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> KDE 1.0 released <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
	
1998-06-21  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* general.cpp (GeneralWidget): modified checkbox-size to avoid
	warnings from QGManager

1998-06-18  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* edit.cpp (ScriptWidget): deactivated "Use default script"-option
	as long as someone comes up with a default script

1998-06-02  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* replaced klocale->translate() with i18n() and every reference to
	XPPP with KPPP
	* utilize ´kapp´ (defined in kapp.h) instead of the global ´extern
	KApplication *app´
	(Sorry about the large amount of changes, but I couldn´t resist to 
        clean up the code)

1998-06-02  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* pppdata.cpp: removed workaround, since KConfig fix is in place now

Mon Jun  1 16:13:06 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* kppp did´nt like "$" in modem strings, fixed that
	
Sun May 24 23:39:42 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* Applied FreeBSD patch for the modem devices
	  Affected File:general.cpp pppdata.cpp
	  Look for __FreeBSD__

Mon May 18 19:51:56 1998  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* introduced a separate log-viewer "kppplogview"
	* removed the no-more needed entry widget for the log-viewer
	* removed test code checking for log viewer

1998-05-15  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* pppdata.cpp: temporary workaround for KConfig bug concerning
	lists without a trailing separator 

Fri May 15 22:27:02 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>
	* removed the writeline("") once again, it does not work

1998-05-12  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* added support for multiple telephone numbers (separated by ':')
	Patch contributed by Sebastian Rittau <srittau@jroger.in-berlin.de>
	
Tue May 12 18:55:02 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* the format of the accounting logfile has changed to allow
	  easier parsing from external files:
	  
	  the format is:
	  CONNECT_TIME_FROM:CONNECTION_PEER:CURRENCY_SYMBOL: \
	  CONNECT_TIME_UNTIL:SUBTOTAL:TOTAL:BYTES_IN_BYTES_OUT	

	  there´s a small tcl script which converts the log files. Simply
	  use "tclsh convlog.tcl" will convert all log-files, but NOT
	  delete the old ones.

Mon May  4 17:19:12 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Austrian rule files updated
	* LSM updated
	* line-limit for /etc/resolv.conf raised to 128
	* fixed the hard-coded line-limit in removedns() to use
	  MAX_RESOLV_CONF instead (128)	
	* added writeLine("") in connect.cpp to make sure that the modem
	  is in ready state (waiting for AT*)
	* support for internal ISDN cards on Linux via modem emulation 
	  (/dev/ttyI*)

1998-04-30  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: undid my stupid PAP/CHAP changes from yesterday

1998-04-29  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: prevented segfault on invalid lockfiles
	* runtests.cpp: /etc/resolv.conf will be created if missing 
	* connect.cpp: fixed reversal of command line options for PAP/CHAP

Tue Apr 28 20:57:04 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added CHAP (client side only) authentication

1998-04-27  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* general.cpp (GeneralWidget): command line option "quit after
	end of connection" is availabe via GUI, too.
	* hangup(): made another usleep() adjustable to prevent hanging 
	(thanks to A.D.Y. Cheng <adyc100@hkstar.com> for pointing that out)

Fri Apr 24 18:57:46 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* general.cpp (GeneralWidget): removed the entry field for
	  the path to the pppd binary

Fri Apr 24 13:03:02 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp: kppp now does not allow anymore the user
	  to specify a path to the pppd binary, but searches for
	  it 
	* kppp now checks if pppd is owned by root
	* kppp does not anymore drop suid before starting pppd

Thu Apr 23 22:35:31 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Fixed a few security holes: kppp drops suid before executing pppd,
	  checks for buffer overflow with the -c command line switch,
	  drops suid before checking a file with -r

Thu Apr 16 21:21:03 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: set portable locale settings for numerical values,
	since the rulefiles will always have a point as decimal delimiter.

1998-04-15  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: extended parseargs() to deal with quoted arguments
	* fixed bug in 'Save' that made multiple use impossible.
	* enclosed username and password with quotes to ensure proper
	handling of whitespace characters
	* pap.cpp: fixed regexp to recognize entries in pap-secrets with
	usernames that are either quoted or preceeded by whitspace. Phew !
	That should eliminate one source of these "pppd	died" errors.
	
Mon Apr  6 20:18:40 1998    <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a volume accounting bug
	* volume accounting is now configureable (bytes in, out, in/out)
	* added new feature (very usefull for sysadmins). If there´s a
	file /etc/kppp.allow, only users from that file may use kppp to
	dial out. Format is one entry per line, comments begin with "#",
	users specified by their login names
	* fixed a bug where the PAP authetication record was only removed
	from /etc/ppp/pap-secrets if an external program is started on 
	login (stupid me :-)	

Wed Apr  1 21:09:05 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: small fixes for 'Scan'

Tue Mar 31 18:54:13 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>
	
	* connect.cpp: corrected stripping of whitespace from 'scanvar'
	* main scripting loop idles until 'Scan' is completed
	* added new keyword 'Save' to store scanned strings
 	* cleaned up add_domain(), adddns(), removedns() by adding data()
 	calls where QString variables are passed as const char* parameters

Mon Mar 30 22:02:07 1998    <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added volume accounting (currently, only inbytes are counted,
	but should be very easy to change). Unfortunatly, there´s no
	method yet to reset the number of bytes, so you have to fiddle
	around in kppprc.	

Wed Mar 18 21:47:20 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* runtests.cpp: added check for 'lock' option in /etc/ppp/options.
	Hopefully, this check isn't too harsh and won't cause any false alarms.

Wed Mar 18 01:13:50 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* modemcmds.cpp: replaced 'Modem Sustains Fast Init' (from general.cpp)
	option by an adjustable 'Init Delay'. Some users reported that they
 	had to increase the delay time to prevent kppp from hanging
 	after ATZ.

Mon Mar 16 03:37:04 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* command line options need to be parse after creating a KApplications
	due to some changes by Matthias in kapp I think.

1998-03-15  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: added mini-icon for all kppp windows, not just 
	  the main window

Mon Mar  9 00:17:20 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* added new script keyword 'scan', see the documentation.
	  It allows for password challenges etc.

Tue Feb 24 19:19:44 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* pap.cpp, connect.cpp: removed the need for a "+ua" option
	  for PAP. Unfortunatly this REQUIRES that kppp can write
	  /etc/ppp/pap-secrets (either by running SUID root or
	  by group permissions)

Fri Feb 13 01:12:19 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* loginterm.cpp: implemented the possibility to log in via
	a simple terminal window. Should have developed a generic widget
	that could have been shared by Miniterm, the debug window and
	loginterm, but I didn't want to touch the rest of the stuff yet.
	* kpppconfig.h: increased max. script size to 20

Thu Feb  5 22:00:55 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* pppdata.cpp: added pppdError() and setpppdError()
	* main.cpp: added new error message for timeout
	* removed last remaining command_on_disconnect bug (see Jan 24)

Sat Jan 31 19:56:03 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: in some cases kppp connected to an account 
	different from the one selected in the combo box. Added
	setAccount() in connectbutton() to fix that, hopefully.

Sun Jan 25 00:45:45 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* docking.cpp: included a hide() statement to cleanly undock
	the widget from the panel. Otherwise the window stayed invisible
	after one dock/undock-cycle.

Sat Jan 24 03:40:44 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed a bug (occuring twice) that caused the if-statement for
	command_on_connect and command_on_disconnect to be always true.

Fri Jan 23 01:32:57 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed alignment in conwindow.cpp's layout.

Wed Jan 21 03:22:43 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* prevented the password from being left in kppprc after the
 	option 'Store password' has just been turned off
	
	* the ID & password field will be disabled if no account has
	been created yet

	* pppdata.cpp: removed absolute path for default log viewer
	to prevent warning messages upon first startup if KDE's location
 	differs from /usr/local/kde

	* removed gpppdata.Id() and gpppdata.setId() since they have been
	replaced by storedUsername() and setStoredUsername()

Tue Jan 20 15:30:08 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Sigh. After unintentionally deleting my account for the sixth
	time, I added a yesNo() dialog to confirm deleting an
	account. This is VERY important, because if you click on "Show
	log" and double-click onto a file to view it and you have the bad
	luck that the filename is just over the "Delete" button, the
	account will be gone.

	* runtests.cpp: gpppdata is now saved after modifications in
	runtests(), and the default log viewer is set correctly

Tue Jan 20 03:10:35 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* tried to get the docking window to display a tooltip with transfer
	bytes statistics. Failed. Need to contact Matthias about it.
       
	* Removed the 'Dock' button. It is superfluous. Use the window
	close button to hide the window.

	* fixed the flicker problem that was reintroduced in pppstatdlg.cpp

	* fixed ( hopefully ) a hangup problem on busy redial caused
	by the  modem_in_connect_state varible in connect.cpp

Mon Jan 19 17:51:16 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: the setup dialog is now created on demand. Since in
	most cases we only dial out, creating the setup dialog is a waste
	of CPU and memory. This reduces memory by approx 200KB.

	* geometry managment added to PPP statistic window

	* tried to minimize dependencies on "main.h" by removing unneeded
	#includes

	* removed homedir.(cpp|h). It can be easily replaced with
	QDir::homeDirPath().

	* before doing anything else, a few tests will be started to
	ensure that i.e. the pppd binary is found...

Mon Jan 19 12:05:00 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* set default for get_dock_into_panel() to false as safety
	  precaution
	
	* introduced docking. It allows kppp to be run as a small
 	  animated icon on the panel. Clicking on the icon with the left
	  mouse button restores the regular window. The right button
 	  opens up a popup menu with other options.

Mon Jan 19 04:46:39 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* reset PHONENUMBER_SIZE to 60. People with phone cards need lots
	space.

Fri Jan 16 21:41:08 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* some improvements to the toplevel Makefile.am. rpath is very
	important for setuid programs

Fri Jan 16 19:04:35 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Improved Makefiles. Now documentation and rulesets are correctly
	uninstalled with "make uninstall"

	* Toplevel Makefile.am improved. Subdir traversal is only done for
	installing, not for compiling

	* fixed that "segfault-on-rulecheck" bug introduced by coolo's
	modifications for locale support.

	* RuleSet::checkRuleFile() now returns 0 on success, otherwise
	1. kppp uses this as exit value.

	* fixed a bug in the swiss rulesets

	* added file "checkrules" in Rules. It autochecks all rules found
	and reports bad rulesets.

Thu Jan 15 20:31:14 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Ported kppp to use automake. 

	* Since the rulefiles now have separate subdirectories, I have
	removed the prefix (i.e. Spain/Spain_Inovia.rst -->
	Spain/Inovia.rst). Since the old files still exist it should be no
	problem for users of former kppp versions.

	* renamed config.h to kpppconfig.h because it conflicts with the
	default include file config.h, generated from autoconf

Wed Jan 14 12:12:29 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: pressing Enter in ID_Edit moves focus to PW_Edit, in
	PW_Edit moves focus to the connect-button

Wed Jan 14 04:13:57 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed a bug that caused passwords to be spread among other accounts.
	  Triggering XPPPWidget::entryChanged() had a nasty side effect. 

Tue Jan 13 17:50:07 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* fixed a bug introduced with the creation of the 'execute command
	  on disconnect' option

	* CD is by default off. It doesn't work on my internal modem 
	  and I suspect it might not even work on most (all) internal modems ..

Tue Jan 13 12:02:33 1998  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@sime.com>
	* the PAP authentication file is now created in the users
	  homedirectory. Otherwise I'd have to create the directory 
	  myself and fix the permissions if kppp runs suid root - 
	  I'm too lazy for that.

	* fixed a security bug in connect.cpp, a typical buffer
	  overflow. Very bad for setuid root programs

Thu Jan 13 06:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* make new behaviour optional (in response to Bernd's worry 
	  about cheap modems.)

Thu Jan 13 06:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* patch to prevent kppp hang if modem is off when connecting.


Tue Jan 13 02:48:55 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* applied BSD patch from Alex <garbanzo@hooked.net>
	  (just a few missing includes)

	* various fixes and geometry improvements

	* added a linedit for a command to be executed on disconnect
	

Mon Jan 12 17:18:41 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* username and password are now remembered between
	session. Remembering the password can be switched off for each
	account.

	checked if the lockfile is a regular file and no more than
	32 characters are read from this file, no matter how long it is.

	client-side-authentication should now be VERY easy. Sorry,
	no CHAP support so far.

	If this checkbox is checked, all scriptedit controls are disabled.

	* docs/kppp.sgml: updated the docs for the new KDE file system
	  standard. Ispell'ed the docu.

	  usefull in combination with "-c". Instead of returning to
	  the kppp main window kppp will exit after disconnecting.

	  included them directly with "#include". This saves 
	  approx. 30 KB in the binary and greatly speeds up

	* added modem_in_connect_state, and checks for it
