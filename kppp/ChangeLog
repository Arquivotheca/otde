Tue Jan 20 15:30:08 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mario@loki.valhalla.at>

	* runtests.cpp: gpppdata is now saved after modifications in
	runtests(), and the default log viewer is set correctly

Tue Jan 20 03:10:35 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* tried to get the docking window to display tooltip with transfer
	bytes statistice. Failed. Need to contact Matthias about it.
       
	* Removed the 'Dock' button. It is superfluous. Use the window
	close button to hide the window.

	* fixed the flicker problem that was reintroduced in pppstatdlg.cpp

	* fixed ( hopefully ) a hangup problem on busy redial caused
	by the  modem_in_connect_state varible in connect.cpp

Mon Jan 19 17:51:16 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: the setup dialog is now created on demand. Since in
	most cases we only dial out, creating the setup dialog is a waste
	of CPU and memory. This reduces memory by approx 200KB.

	* geometry managment added to PPP statistic window

	* tried to minimize dependencies on "main.h" by removing unneeded
	#includes

	* removed homedir.(cpp|h). It can be easily replaced with
	QDir::homeDirPath().

	* before doing anything else, a few tests will be started to
	ensure that i.e. the pppd binary is found...

Mon Jan 19 12:05:00 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* set default for get_dock_into_panel() to false as safety
	  precaution
	
	* introduced docking. It allows kppp to be run as a small
 	  animated icon on the panel. Clicking on the icon with the left
	  mouse button restores the regular window. The right button
 	  opens up a popup menu with other options.

Mon Jan 19 04:46:39 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* reset PHONENUMBER_SIZE to 60. People with phone cards need lots
	space.

Fri Jan 16 21:41:08 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* some improvements to the toplevel Makefile.am. rpath is very
	important for setuid programs

Fri Jan 16 19:04:35 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Improved Makefiles. Now documentation and rulesets are correctly
	uninstalled with "make uninstall"

	* Toplevel Makefile.am improved. Subdir traversal is only done for
	installing, not for compiling

	* fixed that "segfault-on-rulecheck" bug introduced by coolo's
	modifications for locale support.

	* RuleSet::checkRuleFile() now returns 0 on success, otherwise
	1. kppp uses this as exit value.

	* fixed a bug in the swiss rulesets

	* added file "checkrules" in Rules. It autochecks all rules found
	and reports bad rulesets.

Thu Jan 15 20:31:14 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Ported kppp to use automake. 

	* Since the rulefiles now have separate subdirectories, I have
	removed the prefix (i.e. Spain/Spain_Inovia.rst -->
	Spain/Inovia.rst). Since the old files still exist it should be no
	problem for users of former kppp versions.

	* renamed config.h to kpppconfig.h because it conflicts with the
	default include file config.h, generated from autoconf

Wed Jan 14 12:12:29 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: pressing Enter in ID_Edit moves focus to PW_Edit, in
	PW_Edit moves focus to the connect-button

Wed Jan 14 04:13:57 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed a bug that caused passwords to be spread among other accounts.
	  Triggering XPPPWidget::entryChanged() had a nasty side effect. 

Tue Jan 13 17:50:07 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* fixed a bug introduced with the creation of the 'execute command
	  on disconnect' option

	* CD is by default off. It doesn't work on my internal modem 
	  and I suspect it might not even work on most (all) internal modems ..

Tue Jan 13 12:02:33 1998  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@sime.com>
	* the PAP authentication file is now created in the users
	  homedirectory. Otherwise I'd have to create the directory 
	  myself and fix the permissions if kppp runs suid root - 
	  I'm too lazy for that.

	* fixed a security bug in connect.cpp, a typical buffer
	  overflow. Very bad for setuid root programs

Thu Jan 13 06:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* make new behaviour optional (in response to Bernd's worry 
	  about cheap modems.)

Thu Jan 13 06:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* patch to prevent kppp hang if modem is off when connecting.


Tue Jan 13 02:48:55 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* applied BSD patch from Alex <garbanzo@hooked.net>
	  (just a few missing includes)

	* various fixes and geometry improvements

	* added a linedit for a command to be executed on disconnect
	

Mon Jan 12 17:18:41 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* username and password are now remembered between
	session. Remembering the password can be switched off for each
	account.

	* connect.cpp: fixed 2 security bugs in lockfile(). Not it's
	checked if the lockfile is a regular file and no more than
	32 characters are read from this file, no matter how long it is.

	* Added PAP authentication option and code. Using PAP (at least
	client-side-authentication should now be VERY easy. Sorry,
	no CHAP support so far.
	
	* edit.cpp: Added a checkbox if to use kppp's default script.
	If this checkbox is checked, all scriptedit controls are disabled.

Sun Jan 11 21:03:00 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* lslisder in modemcmd.cpp wasn't set correctely on widget
	  creation. 


Thu Jan 11 14:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>
	* (0.8.10) incorporate iconify_on_connect patch.


Sat Jan 10 21:23:10 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: fixed a bug that cause kppp to go wild and display
	hundreds of windows when it cannot load a ruleset file

Wed Jan  7 13:00:24 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* edit.cpp: improved the IP and Gateway widgets

	* various improvements for the geometry managements

Tue Jan  6 12:56:14 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: the main kppp window has now layout control

	* connect.cpp: layouted the connection window.

	* modeminfo.cpp (ModemInfo): layoutet the modeminfo dialog
	  and layouted the ModemTransfer dialog (ATI query)

Mon Jan  5 20:59:00 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* accounting.cpp: telephone costs are stored in kppprc now.
	  ~/.kde/share/apps/kppp/Costs is obsolete.
	* pppdata.cpp: added totalCosts() and setTotalCosts().
	  Several small cosmetic changes.  
	
Mon Jan  5 14:25:37 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* docs/kppp.sgml: updated the docs for the new KDE file system
	  standard. Ispell'ed the docu.

	* main.cpp: added the "-q" command line switch. This is very
	  usefull in combination with "-c". Instead of returning to
	  the kppp main window kppp will exit after disconnecting.

	* Makefile.in: removed the external moc_*.cpp files and
	  included them directly with "#include". This saves 
	  approx. 30 KB in the binary and greatly speeds up 
	  compilation

Mon Jan  5 13:59:20 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Rules/TEMPLATE: fixed a typo: the extension of ruleset
	  files is ".rst", not ".rts"

Mon Jan  5 13:42:28 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* general.cpp: replaced the KIntLineEdit class with the
	  class KIntegerLine from libkdeui. Replaced the progress
	  widget with that from libkdeui.

Mon Jan  5 12:51:43 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* edit.cpp: now all major dialogs use Qt layout

Mon Jan  5 04:55:58 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* fixed the while(*it) problem in pppdata.cpp it should be
	  while(it->current()).

Sun Jan  4 13:54:12 1998  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@sime.com>
	* modified the modemcommands dialog to use the layout
	  classes of Qt. Replaced the scrollbar with a slider,
	  because scrollbars are not the right widget to change
	  values.

Thu Jan  2 00:25:03 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>
	* added modem_in_connect_state, and checks for it
          to avoid unneccessary delays on modem initialization.
	  delay of 2 seconds will still occur on hangup by default.
	  I think that's bearable.
	* Added modem tricks section, gentle introduction.

Thu Dec 25 11:46:34 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

        * Added new script keywords: PwPrompt and ID
	* Added ID and Password LineEdits on the main dialog window
	* KConfig transition is now complete, one more time the data
	  storage format has changed. ( Hopefully the last time )

	* All sorts of little cosmetic changes
	* fixed up the mini-terminal a bit

Sun Dec 22 23:00:03 1997  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* To fix hangup problems:
	* Added programmable guard time around escape sequence
	* Separated escape sequence from hangup command

Sun Dec 21 10:19:18 1997  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* Changed maxloopnest to MAXLOOPNEST for portability reasons 
	  (See developers guide, about const int)
	* Set window titles when connected to account name.

Fri Dec 19 22:49:18 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* Extended the grammar of the tarif rules. 
	  New keyword: flat_init_costs necessitated by the new french
	  accounting rules.

Tue Dec 16 01:54:50 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* extended scripting capabilities to allow password dialogs

Sun Nov  2 14:02:31 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* accounts.cpp: applied mario's patches to the rulessets. Now deals
	  with fractions too. 
	* accounts.cpp: fixed the bug that caused kppp to reset the costs 
	  even if you chose cancel.
	* docs/kppp.sgml: doc updates and corrections

Fri Aug 15 21:25:05 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* connect.cpp: leaving the lock file name edit blank will cause
	kppp not to create lock files. That is this turn the use of lock files off

	* added option to not disconnect on xserver exit/crash

Sun Aug 10 19:07:07 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* kppp will no automatically disconnect on X-server exit

Sun Jul 20 17:26:58 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* fixed bug in phone cost accounting
