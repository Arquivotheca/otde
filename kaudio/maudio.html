<LI>It uses <I>/dev/dsp</I>. You cannot configure him to use other devices
currently.</LI>

<LI>It also grabs <I>/dev/dsp</I> and releases it after a short period
of idle time.</LI>

<LI>This version is much improved against the last versions. Still it has
problems with leading and trailing garbage, which will often get played.</LI>
