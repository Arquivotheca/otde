Hello, this is kaudioserver. It is supposed to be started up automatically
on startup of KDE. Please add it to your KDE startup script. Put it as soon
as possible, i.e. as first program before all other application.

kaudioserver needs maudio as backend player. If it is not available,
kaudioserver will terminate, but will not stop KDE from working.
But its much more fun, if you get maudio from ftp.kde.org . :-)

It will be ported to Sun and other platforms some day, so you may get
"instant" audio on all platforms if you start using libmediatool and
friends now. :-)
Use KAudio class to play sounds easily.

Have fun,
       Chris
