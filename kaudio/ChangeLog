* Implementing multi buffering (actual here: double buffering)
    This should fix playing trailing garbage and is a neccesity
    on "slow" computers.

* maudio.cpp : Moved from device name to device number. Added command
    line option "-devnum <devnum>", to attach to another device than the
    default device
* io_oss.cpp : Added mapping from device number to device name. You can
    now attach to any device called /dev/dspX , with X in [0..9] . This
    is useful if you have multiple audio devices or the SoftOSS extensions.

* kaudioserver.cpp (main): fixed segfault on startup. return value
  of fopen on line 123 was ignored which led to a sefault of fclose.
