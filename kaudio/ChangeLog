	*  Checked, why long media caused pops and noises. Found out maudio was not
	the guilty one, but the UI kmedia, which caused a dirty loopback
	with maudio.
	* some cleanups
	* emitSilence() is called now always, if device is open and not playing any
	useful data. This is especially important when the automaton is in state "PAUSE".
	* Multi Buffers get cleared now when a new media gets opened. This fixes the
	"repeated output" bug nobody reported till now.
	* Warped the verison number to V0.80. We are nearing the final 1.0 version :-)
	* Adding "-version" command line switch

	* Multi-Buffering allows easy pre-read and pre-write. Implemented
	it, this should fix annoying "trailing garbage" bug.

	* Implementing real multi buffering. Audioserver is now prepared
	for V1.0


Thu Apr  9 19:16:11 CEST 1998 Christian Esken <esken@kde.org>

	* Implementing multi buffering (actual here: double buffering).
	This should fix playing trailing garbage and is a neccesity
	on "slow" computers.

	* maudio.cpp : Moved from device name to device number. Added command
	line option "-devnum <devnum>", to attach to another device than the
	default device
	* io_oss.cpp : Added mapping from device number to device name. You can
	now attach to any device called /dev/dspX , with X in [0..9] . This
	is useful if you have multiple audio devices or the SoftOSS extensions.

	* kaudioserver.cpp (main): fixed segfault on startup. return value
	of fopen on line 123 was ignored which led to a sefault of fclose.
