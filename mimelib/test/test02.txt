Subject: Here's a simple message

Since its publication in 1982, STD 11, RFC 822 [RFC-822] has defined
the standard format of textual mail messages on the Internet.  Its
success has been such that the RFC 822 format has been adopted,
wholly or partially, well beyond the confines of the Internet and the
Internet SMTP transport defined by STD 10, RFC 821 [RFC-821].  As the
format has seen wider use, a number of limitations have proven
increasingly restrictive for the user community.
