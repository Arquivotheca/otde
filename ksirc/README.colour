KSirc does Colours?

KSirc follows the colour scheme used by mIrc and a slight modification
for more powerfull in house use.

<fg> == foreground
<bg> == background
[] == optional

** mIrc compatibility:

Format: 0x03<fg>[,<bg>]   sets the foreground and background
        0x03              resets to defaults for THAT line
        
        
Nothing special is done, there's no way to enter mirc colours right now.

** KSirc native:

Format: ~<fg>[,<bg>]      sets the foreground and background
        ~c                resets tp defaults
        ~b                sets bold font
        ~u                sets underline
        ~i                sets italics
        
Why did I change ksirc to use ~ instead of 0x03 (^C)? Well, it's hard to
use 0x03 in scripts and not all C functions seem to like it.
~<letter> also alows more commands while not stomping on mirc's future
changes.
