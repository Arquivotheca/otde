$Added ordering of ops to the top of the nick list.  Design is pretty simple:
$
$1. Added a seperator with know uniq text.
$
$2. If the nick is an op (passed by a flag) add them before the sep
$
$3. If not after the sep.
$
$Adding in each section is done alphabertically, again pretty easy.
$Step through each nick and use strcmp, if is returns <, then we should
$keep going since our word is furthur down the alphabet.  If it's >=
$stop, backup one and add the word into that location.
$
$We have to check for the end of the list since we can't insert max+1, it
$has to be -1.
$
$The Seperator is a custom list item of height 3 and width of the listbox.
$It simply draws a straight line, and off it goes.
