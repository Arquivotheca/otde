  	Looking into it.

 	queired and can suply it's own filter rules.  Usefull for DCC and

 	each toplevel needs a filter rule.

 	single ~. ~~ is always garunteed to print ~.

Revision 1.11  1998/01/10 17:46:51  asj
Added lag-o-meter.

This meant updating filters.pl to have support for the /lag command.
It uses the syscall() interface. I've wrapped it in enough eval{}'s
so it should be ok.  Problems will result for people who don't have
sys/syscall.ph though and don't use linux!!!

ioLAG.cpp is pretty simple, and I think pretty safe.

updated ksircprocess, etc for ioLAG.cpp

Revision 1.10  1998/01/03 01:45:12  asj
Added ChangeLog update.

Revision 1.9  1998/01/03 01:44:11  asj
Applied wilton's patch, made it work to my taste.  We need to edit the
ksiticker and add it's own colour support, this looks real shitty on my
machine.

I think the list box's ordering works seemy corretly now.

Revision 1.8  1998/01/01 21:02:11  asj
Various bug fixed all over the place.  Added ksirc.pl, documentation update, etc.

Revision 1.7  1997/12/31 04:27:09  asj
Misc bug fixes, updates.  Fixed mem leak in KSTicer, etc.

Revision 1.6  1997/12/27 04:20:50  asj
1. Fixed resive screw up in mainw

2. added clear responce in toplevel.cpp, now resets screen.  Fixed irclistbox
to handle this.  (needed it anyways)

3. Auto create should be working better.

4. Fixed problem in auto create and auto following invites, most annoying.

5. Added filter control mechanism where each ksircmessagereceiver can
reply with a default set of filter rules it requires.

6. cleaed up ~ a little bit. ~~ now prints a single ~.  This is usefull
for scripts which can look for stray ~ which may be taken as a control
character when they're only inline in the text.

Default filter rules now include:

* Italics, bold, and underline ascii to ksirc conversion.

* DCC redirected to DCC module.

Revision 1.5  1997/12/26 05:56:20  asj
Removed annoying $$

Revision 1.4  1997/12/26 05:55:30  asj
Test of interpolation.

Revision 1.3  1997/12/26 05:54:36  asj
Added ordering of ops to the top of the nick list.  Design is pretty simple:

1. Added a seperator with know uniq text.

2. If the nick is an op (passed by a flag) add them before the sep

3. If not after the sep.

Adding in each section is done alphabertically, again pretty easy.
Step through each nick and use strcmp, if is returns <, then we should
keep going since our word is furthur down the alphabet.  If it's >=
stop, backup one and add the word into that location.

We have to check for the end of the list since we can't insert max+1, it
has to be -1.

The Seperator is a custom list item of height 3 and width of the listbox.
It simply draws a straight line, and off it goes.

Revision 1.2  1997/12/25 07:54:42  asj
Added Revision...

Revision 1.1  1997/12/25 07:52:51  asj
