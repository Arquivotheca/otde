	* toplevel.cpp (resizeEvent): fixed resize problem.
	(parse_input): Added `sirc clear handeling.
	(parse_input): I think I fixed the auto create auto joining windows

	* Added filter rule control mechanisim where each module is
 	queired and can suply it's own filter rules.  Usefull for DCC and
 	bolding etc.  Be carefull with toplevel, since there's multiple
 	instances each will suppy it's rule, and should ONLY be used if
 	each toplevel needs a filter rule.

	* irclistitem.cpp (colourDrawText): Added ~~ to escape and print a
 	single ~. ~~ is always garunteed to print ~.

	* ioBroadcast.cpp (defaultRules): Added a a default rule to seek
 	out stray ~[bcui]nick@someplace due to bad idents and to escape
 	the ~.

Revision 1.5  1997/12/26 05:56:20  asj
Removed annoying $$

Revision 1.4  1997/12/26 05:55:30  asj
Test of interpolation.

Revision 1.3  1997/12/26 05:54:36  asj
Added ordering of ops to the top of the nick list.  Design is pretty simple:

1. Added a seperator with know uniq text.

2. If the nick is an op (passed by a flag) add them before the sep

3. If not after the sep.

Adding in each section is done alphabertically, again pretty easy.
Step through each nick and use strcmp, if is returns <, then we should
keep going since our word is furthur down the alphabet.  If it's >=
stop, backup one and add the word into that location.

We have to check for the end of the list since we can't insert max+1, it
has to be -1.

The Seperator is a custom list item of height 3 and width of the listbox.
It simply draws a straight line, and off it goes.
