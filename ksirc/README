[1] Why should I use KSirc?

    1.1. You're looking for a powerful, and reasonably easy to use irc
    client that works well under X, support multiple windows, filter
    rules, colours, etc.

    1.2. ircII has a pretty poor scripting language.  Sirc's perl scripting
    is flexible and reasonably secure.  Combined with #1.1 gives you an X
    irc client with good scripting.

[2] System requirements

    For the static binaries you don't need anything except a working X.

    To compile and run the source you'll need:

	g++ 2.7.2.3	
        KDE Support and KDE Libraries > 971220
	QT Libraries 1.31

     Platforms so-far tested with gcc/g++ 2.7.x:
	Linux
	FreeBSD/OpenBSD
	SunOS
	Solaris

[3] How Do I install it?

    KSirc at this time MUST be run from the ksirc directory.  This
    will change in the future, it just makes development a little
    easiser.

    3.1 Binary Install

	tar -zxvvf <ksirc file>
	cd ksirc-bin
	./ksirc

    3.2 Source Install

	Edit the makefile and set your PATHs for KDEDIR and QTDIR.
	make
	./ksirc

    4.2 Credit where credit it due:

        KSirc uses sirc for all the irc server interaction, scripting
        etc.  The excellent sirc client is orabidoo
        <roger.espel.llima@pobox.com>.  For more information on sirc
        have a look at it's home page:
