TODO:
        - protocol (otalk/ntalk) detection in talkconn.cpp (for forwards)
	- communication with ktalk via unix domain sockets
        - a 'not here' option, which launches the answmach at once. Will be 
            useful when a swallowed app. exists : when you leave, you switch
            'on' the answmach
        - if a tty is more recent than X, take the tty for announcement.
        - insensitive case and long logins supported for user names (big problem).
        - a kdelnk file, not for launching ktalkd, but to make
             kdehelp's helpindex find ktalkd :)   - how to avoid it to appear
           in the K menu ?

	AND (out of ktalkd):
        * a kde app. swallowed in kpanel, to choose options like "refuse talks",
          "activate/desactivate answering machine" and to launch a talk client, 
	  and to set up forwardings.             - could be part of ktalk.
