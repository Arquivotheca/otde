ktalkd needs the snprintf function, but some system don't have it (some
Solaris versions, for instance).

If snprintf is missing on your system, you can do the following :

* compile ktalkd/kotalkd/vsnprintf.c, by entering 'make vsnprintf.o' in this
directory. (there might be warnings, don't be afraid of them...)
* if it compiles
  - add vsnprintf.c to the kotalkd_SOURCES line in ktalkd/kotalkd/Makefile 
  - add vsnprintf.c to the ktalkd_SOURCES line (the one that is not commented)
       in ktalkd/ktalkd/Makefile 
  then run make from the toplevel directory again.

Many thanks to Olof S Kylander <olof@frozenriver.com> for providing vsnprintf.c
