# Config file for ktalkd.
# There is now a "Settings" entry with a configuration program
# for the user's ktalkdrc. But how to provide a nice way to set systemwide params?

# Set to 1 to activate answering machine 
# Warning : if set to 0, no user will be able to activate it.
# (The value won't overwrite this one).
Answmach=1

# Mail sender (can be mail.local, sendmail(preferred), qmail(as good:)) )
#  mail.local is included in the dist., just in case you don't have sendmail
MailProg=$KDEBINDIR/mail.local

# Set this to 1 if you wish to use X-aware announcement. (Why not ?)
XAnnounce=1

# External program launched by ktalkd to notify a talk. Can be :
# ktalkdlg, a pop-up KDE dialog box, which can launch any talk client
# or ktalk, the KDE talk client.
# Will be launched with the caller's address as parameter
#   KDEBINDIR will be set by ktalkd.
ExtPrg=$KDEBINDIR/ktalkdlg

# [If ktalkdlg] : which talk client should ktalkdlg launch ?
# The default is "$KDEBINDIR/kvt -e talk"
#   KDEBINDIR will be set by ktalkd.
talkprg=$KDEBINDIR/kvt -e talk

# [If ktalkdlg only, currently]
# Set to 1 to enable talk notifications with sound.
Sound=1
# Sound file - ktalkd.wav is included

# What should I do if somebody tries to talk to a non-existent user ?
# 0 = Launch answer machine saying 'non-existent user...' 
#                  and 'I' receive the message (to know that it happened)
# 1 = 'I' take the talk         NOT WORKING : you won't be able to answer !
# 2 = Do nothing. ('Not logged' will appear to caller).
NEUBehaviour=2

# (Multi-user secured host : set Behaviour=2).
# (Multi-user host : set Behaviour=0 and User=root or postmaster)
# (Almost single-user networked PC : set Behaviour=1 and User=your_user_name)

# If you choose 0, then you can set the following
#   (no internationalization possible : this file is manually read by ktalkd)
NEUBanner1=The person you're asking to talk with is unknown at this host.
NEUBanner2=You may have mistyped the name, or network address. Try again
NEUBanner3=or leave a message which will be sent to the system administrator.

# Who is 'I' ?  (=> who should take the talk / receive the message)
NEUUser=

# Commandline option for the talk client to appear as a different user.
# Only important if NEUBehaviour is 1. You *have* to set it if NEUBehaviour=1.
#NEUSetUserName=--user

# Do you wish to receive an empty mail if the caller didn't leave any message ?
#   (If "1", you'll only know who called you)
EmptyMail=1

# Time before launching answering machine (not very important)
Time=10
