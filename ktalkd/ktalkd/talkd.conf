# /etc/talkd.conf
#
# This is the config file for ktalkd, the talk daemon by David Faure
#
# Wait for actual ktalkd to terminate before changes are taken into account.
# 
# Boolean values can be 0/1, off/on, false/true
# Syntax : "key: value"  (no space between key and ':')
# If a key is absent, the value set at compile time will be set.

# Set this to 1 if you want an answering machine to take incoming 
# calls to absent persons. The caller will be able to leave a message 
Answmach: on

# If Answmach is set, Time is the time between the 'ringing your party again'
# message and the launching of the answering machine, in seconds.
Time: 10

# MailProg is the name of your mail daemon, which can be 'sendmail'
#  or it can be mail.local, included in the distribution.
# Not yet tested with 'qmail', nor any other...
# Note : mail.local works ok, but doesn't make your xbiff alert you
#        so sendmail is recommended for those who use it.
MailProg: mail.local

# Set this to 'off' if all you want is a beep to notify you of talk
# requests, to 'on' if you want to play an audio file instead.
Sound: on

# Define this to the full path of the sound file you wish to
# have played when you recieve talk requests. It may be of
# any format, as long as the player defined below is capable
# of playing it.
SoundFile: /usr/lib/talkd/talk.wav

# Set this to the command you will be using to play audio
# files. This can be any .wav, .au, .snd or whatever player,
# just so long as it will play the format that your chosen
# audio file is in.
SoundPlayer: /usr/local/bin/wavplay
SoundPlayerOpt: -q        
# ==> SoundPlayer + SoundPlayerOpt = /usr/local/bin/wavplay -q

# Set this to 'on' if you wish to use X-aware announcement.
XAnnounce: off

# Contents of the talk request, 3 lines.
# First one must include %d:%02d for the time of the request
# Second one must include a '%s' for the caller name and machine 
# Third one must include %s, for caller address
Announce1: Message from Talk_Daemon at %d:%02d ...
Announce2: talk: connection requested by %s.
Announce3: talk: respond with: talk %s

# What should I do if somebody tries to talk to a non-existent user ?
# 0 = Launch answer machine saying 'non-existent user...'
#                  and 'I' receive the message (to know that it happened)
# 1 = 'I' take the talk. cf NEUUser and NEUSetUserName
# 2 = Do nothing. ('Not logged' will appear to caller).
NEUBehaviour: 2

# If you choose 0, then you can set the following
#   (no internationalization possible : this file is manually read by ktalkd)
#NEUBanner1: The person you're asking to talk with is unknown at this host.
#NEUBanner2: You may have mistyped the name, or network address. Try again
#NEUBanner3: or leave a message which will be sent to the system administrator.

# Who is 'I' ?  (=> who should take the talk / receive the message)
#NEUUser:

# Commandline option for the talk client to appear as a different user.
# Only important if NEUBehaviour is 1. You *have* to set it if NEUBehaviour=1.
#NEUSetUserName: --user
