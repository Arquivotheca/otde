	automatically and more accurately.
	The about dialog now contains a KURLLabel that opens an email composer
	when the user clicks on it.
November 2, 1998:
	I missed to store the contents of the "country" field, this bug is fixed
	now.
	Since I reworked the former StringListDialog, all files regarding the 
	old one have changed. These are removed:
		StringListDialog.dlg
		StringListDialog.h  
		StringListDialog.cpp
		StringListDialogData.h 
		StringListDialogData.cpp,
	these are added, they contain the new main widget for the DialogBase 
	deriven dialog class:
		StringListEditWidget.dlg
		StringListEditWidget.h 
		StringListEditWidget.cpp
		StringListEditWidgetData.h
		StringListEditWidgetData.cpp,
	and these contin the dialog itselfes, they are also new:
		StringListEditDialog.h
		StringListEditDialog.cpp.
	Writing dialogs becomes more and more easy using the DialogBase class.
