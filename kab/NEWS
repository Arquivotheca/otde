October 10, 1998:
	I started writing a dialog base class that in future all dialogs 
	will be derived from. It is suited with already-connected standard
	buttons (OK, Apply, Cancel) and some nice visual features (outer
	and inner frame, a common background pixmap for the frames) and
	with ready-to-use geometry management. Hopefully providing cute
	dialogs will became easier now.
	The new dialogs that use this common base class have a main widget
	they manage inside their inner frame. I usually create this widgets 
	with qtarch. 
	And I started to write the NEWS file :-)
