As of 07Jan1998:
FIXED - incorrect fr.kimap (reported and fixed by 
	binois stephane <binois@normandnet.fr>

- illisible/ugly flag icons + wrong highlighting colors in the keyboard 
	selection widget (reported by Torsten Rahn)

- fscked up startup (segfaults and all)

- conflict with vnc (???) (reported by Alex Zepeda)

- segfault on FreeBSD (because of API diffs in execlp) (reported by 
	Hans Petter Bieker <zerium@webindex.no>)

- Alt+Ctrl eats the next key (if window has menus) while Ctrl+Alt doesn't

WORKED AROUND - windows newer than kikbd insensitive to map switching
	keyboard accelerator (e.g. Alt+Ctrl)
