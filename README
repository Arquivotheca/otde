IMPORTANT: You need to set the environment variable QTDIR to your Qt
directory, if it is not in a standard place.

You can use --enable-kscreensaver, if you have Linux. On most other 
systems this app has problems with passwords. So it is disabled by
default.

Please direct any bug reports to me (coolo@itm.mu-luebeck.de). Discussions
should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
