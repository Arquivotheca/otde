IMPORTANT: You need to set the environment variable QTDIR to your Qt
directory, if it is not in a standard place.

On some systems, kscreensaver can't get passwords. You can use 
--disable-kscreensaver if you doesn't want to compile this app.
You can use --enable-debug, if you want to have debug code in your
KDE apps (for alpha testing).

If you have an older kdebase installed, just copy all your .k*rc files
from $HOME to $HOME/.kde/config. In the other case, default values are
used for most apps.

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completly. 

Have a look at VERSIONS, if you want to know, what versions of apps are
included.

Please direct any bug reports to our buglist maintainer 
David McCanney <9504506m@student.gla.ac.uk>. 
If you have problems compiling and installing this package, contact
