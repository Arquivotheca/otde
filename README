IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is 
installed. Please set this in your login file.

If configure claims about missing Qt, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of qt-1.3 or higher. 

You can use --enable-debug, if you want to have debug code in your
KDE apps and libs. I recommend to do this, since this is alpha soft-
ware and you better have the possibility to check, what was wrong.

If you have an older kdebase installed, just copy all your .k*rc files
from $HOME to $HOME/.kde/config. In the other case, default values are
used for most apps.

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely. 

Have a look at VERSIONS, if you want to know, what versions of apps are
included.

If you miss XPM support, it may be, that configure has no idea, where
your xpm libs are. If so, set XPM_INCLUDE and XPM_LDFLAGS to the paths,
where configure should look for xpm. But if you haven't xpm, it's no
problem. You will only miss some screensavers. The same with OPENGL
support. Here you have to set GL_INCLUDE and GL_LDFLAGS.
