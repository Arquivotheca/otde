Common Mistakes
---------------

IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is
installed.  Please set this in your login file.

If you miss XPM support, it may be, that configure has no idea where your
xpm librariess are.  If so, set XPM_INCLUDE and XPM_LDFLAGS to the paths,
where configure should look for xpm.  But if you haven't installed xpm or
it didn't come with your system, that's no problem.  You will only miss a
few screensavers.  The same thing applies with OPENGL support.  Here you
have to set GL_INCLUDE and GL_LDFLAGS.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 1.3 or newer.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

Upgrading
---------

If you have an older kdebase installed, just copy all your .k*rc files
from $HOME to $HOME/.kde/config. In the other case, default values are
used for most apps.

Removal/Uninstallation
----------------------

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.
