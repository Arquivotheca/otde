This is the kdelibs distribution. The libraries are covered (since
Saturday, 21st June 1997) by the GNU Library General License Version 2 or
later (at your option). Please see the file COPYING.LIB for more
information. The examples are covered by the GNU General Public License,
more information can be found in COPYING.

IMPORTANT: You should set the environment variable KDEDIR to the
directory you want to install the KDE files to.  

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at
http://www.troll.no.  Qt 1.3 or newer is needed to install KDE.

Please direct any bug reports to me (kalle@kde.org). General KDE
discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
