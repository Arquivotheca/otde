This is the kdelibs distribution. It is covered (since Saturday, 21st
June 1997) by the GNU Library General License Version 2 or later (at
your option). Please see the file COPYING.LIB for more information.

IMPORTANT: You should set the environment variable KDEDIR to the
directory you want to install the KDE files to.  

If configure claims about Qt not installed, have a look at http://www.troll.no

Please direct any bug reports to me (kalle@kde.org). Discussions
should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
