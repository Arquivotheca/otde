About kdelibs
-------------

This is the version 1.1 (almost) release of the KDE libraries.  Among this
collection are ten (10) libraries that are central to the development and 
execution of a KDE program, internationalization files for these libraries, 
misc HTML documentation, and regression tests.  The ten libraries are:

* kdecore
    This is

* kdeui

* jscript

* kimgio

* khtmlw

* kfmlib

* kfile

* mediatool

* kspell

* kab


Licensing
---------

The libraries themselves have been covered (since Saturday, June 21st, 1997)
by the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).  Any other programs (such as
the examples) are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL).  All the
gory details for the LGPL reside in COPYING.LIB, and for the GPL reside in 
COPYING.

Common Mistakes
---------------

IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is
installed.  Please set this in your login file.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 1.41 or newer.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE libs.  If you have the space and can stand code that's
somewhat slower, this is worth it.  The extra information really
helps debugging and thus bugfixing.

Upgrading
---------

If you have an older kdebase installed, just copy all your .k*rc files
from $HOME to $HOME/.kde/config. In the other case, default values are
used for most apps.

More Info
---------

Please direct any bug reports to me (kalle@kde.org). General KDE
discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
