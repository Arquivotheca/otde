IMPORTANT: You need to set the environment variable QTDIR to your Qt
directory, and you should set the environment variable KDEDIR to the
directory you want to install the KDE files to.  

Please direct any bug reports to me (kalle@kde.org). Discussions
should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
