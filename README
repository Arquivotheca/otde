Common Mistakes
---------------

IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory, where KDE is 
installed. Please set this in your login file.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 1.3 or newer.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

Removal/Uninstallation
----------------------

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.

Please direct any bug reports to our bug list maintainer

If you have problems compiling and installing this package, contact
me at coolo@kde.org.

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).

How to compile kSirc
--------------------

For those with CVS access, you can compile kSirc after doing the following
in the kdenetwork directory:

1. (cd .. && cvs -z9 checkout -r1.10 kdenetwork/ltconfig)
2. mv ltconfig admin/ltconfig
3. Re-run make -f Makefile.cvs and ./configure (not config.guess)

Remember to remove admin/ltconfig before doing any commits so you don't
commit the modified ltconfig.
