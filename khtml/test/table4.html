<H1>Table Test 4</H1>
This page is the fourth regression test out of a set for Table handling.<BR>

It starts with simple tests and gradually moves on to more complex tables. 
All test start with a horizontal rule, some text explianing the test and finally the table. 
The layout of the tables should be sensible and remain so when this windows is being resized.
All tables have border=1 set, to be able to view the size of the columns and rows.
