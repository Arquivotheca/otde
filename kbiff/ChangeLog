   o Replaced QListView with KTreeView.  QListView isn't cool enough to
	  require all kbiff users to upgrade to Qt 1.40.  Maybe after KDE 1.2
	  is released, I'll put it back...

	o Added patch from Ian Denton to use POP3 UIDL to check number of new
	  messages.  Doesn't quite work perfectly, but it's almost there!  Still
	  problems with knowing when POP3 mailbox was "read", though...
	  POP3 code now will attempt to figure out the number of new messages
	  by checking UIDL, then if that fails, it checks STAT, then if that
	  fails, it checks LIST.

   o Checking for new messages in mbox breaks the code!  Added a work-around
	  that may or may not work (didn't test yet).  This will also break
	  random file monitoring (file *must* be in mbox format), so I added
	  a new protocol: "file"
	o Modified Trace class so that it will work with egcs.

   o Changed POP3 code back to using STAT.  Apparently some servers don't
	  return the number of messages with a successful USER/PASS

   o Added code from 'korn' to check number of new messages in mbox.  'Notify'
	  should not correctly list the number of new messages in all four
	  mailbox types.
   o Changed 'getlogin()' to more general form.  Hopefully doesn't break on
	  non-Linux systems.
   o Some bug fixes.

   o Quite a few bug fixes.

	o Added -secure option
	o Added "Read Mail" menu item.  This will set the flags to OldMail if it
	  was New.  This also disables checking for new mail until the "current"
	  new mail becomes old!
