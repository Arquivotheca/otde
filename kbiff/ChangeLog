   o Added code from 'korn' to check number of new messages in mbox.  'Notify'
	  should not correctly list the number of new messages in all four
	  mailbox types.
   o Changed 'getlogin()' to more general form.  Hopefully doesn't break on
	  non-Linux systems.
   o Some bug fixes.

	o Added -secure option
	o Added "Read Mail" menu item.  This will set the flags to OldMail if it
	  was New.  This also disables checking for new mail until the "current"
	  new mail becomes old!
