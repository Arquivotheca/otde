   o Thanks to David Barth (dbarth@videotron.ca) for pointing out that
	  older POP3 servers (ones that don't support UIDL) will cause KBiff
	  to fail even though there is code to get around that...(patched)

   o Put KProcess handling code by itself so that all executing code passes
	  through it.
	o Added profile name to tooltip

   o Added patch by Martin ? <spirk@kla.pvt.cz> to handle arguments for
	  mail client better

   o Removed Qt 1.33 compatibility from CVS version and put back AUTOMOC

10-31-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Released 1.1.6

10-26-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Changed width of Advanced button so that certain translations will
	  fit.

   o Fixed bug in POP3 code where it would *never* go back to "no mail"
	  state if it ever received new mail.

   o Hideously mangled KTreeView to look exactly like QListView... at least
	  as far as kbiff is concerned.  It is *very* ugly.. but it works!  And
	  the cool thing is when I decide to go with QListView (the real one)
	  exclusively, well, I just have to nuke ktreeview.[cpp|h] and remove
	  a few #ifs.

   o Replaced QListView with KTreeView.  QListView isn't cool enough to
	  require all kbiff users to upgrade to Qt 1.40.  Maybe after KDE 1.1
	  is released, I'll put it back...

	o Added patch from Ian Denton to use POP3 UIDL to check number of new
	  messages.  Doesn't quite work perfectly, but it's almost there!  Still
	  problems with knowing when POP3 mailbox was "read", though...
	  POP3 code now will attempt to figure out the number of new messages
	  by checking UIDL, then if that fails, it checks STAT, then if that
	  fails, it checks LIST.

   o Checking for new messages in mbox breaks the code!  Added a work-around
	  that may or may not work (didn't test yet).  This will also break
	  random file monitoring (file *must* be in mbox format), so I added
	  a new protocol: "file"
	o Modified Trace class so that it will work with egcs.

   o Changed POP3 code back to using STAT.  Apparently some servers don't
	  return the number of messages with a successful USER/PASS

09-24-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Added code from 'korn' to check number of new messages in mbox.  'Notify'
	  should not correctly list the number of new messages in all four
	  mailbox types.
   o Changed 'getlogin()' to more general form.  Hopefully doesn't break on
	  non-Linux systems.
   o Some bug fixes.

09-23-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Quite a few bug fixes.

09-19-98 - Kurt Granroth
	o Added -secure option
	o Added "Read Mail" menu item.  This will set the flags to OldMail if it
	  was New.  This also disables checking for new mail until the "current"
	  new mail becomes old!

09-18-98 - Kurt Granroth
	o Fixed bug in 'scramble'

08-26-08 - Kurt Granroth
	o Added isGIF8x to facilitate animated gifs.
