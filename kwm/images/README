To try out these (ugly) shaped window decorations, please copy all
pixmaps (*.xpm) somewhere where kwm´s iconloader will find them (for
example ~/.kde/share/apps/kwm/pics/). 

Then add this to your kwmrc, group [General]

ShapeMode=on
ShapePixmapTopRight=top_right.xpm
ShapePixmapRight=kwm_right.xpm
ShapePixmapBottom=kwm_bottom.xpm
ShapePixmapLeft=kwm_left.xpm
ShapePixmapTopLeft=top_left.xpm
ShapePixmapBottomRight=bottom_right.xpm
ShapePixmapBottomLeft=bottom_left.xpm
ShapePixmapTop=kwm_top.xpm

Now restart kwm and please do not get a shock ;-)


Enjoy,

     Matthias
