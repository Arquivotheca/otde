This is the new test-release of kvt, the KDE xterm replacement.

Version kvt-0.12 (based on rxvt-2.08)


There are a lot of improvements in this kvt compared to kvt-0.11.
Mainly improvements of the core terminal emulation, not of the GUI.
kvt should be a quite reasonabl xterm-color now :)

If you have problems with the default "TERM=xterm-color" setting on
your system, have a look at ./etc/README


Also new is the command line option "-no_scrollbar".
See ChangeLog for details concerning the changes.

Please note the popmenu on the right mouse button!
(when you miss the menubar ;-) 


Please see also TODO.kvt.

Irix 6.3. SGI O2 R1000
    To compile kvt on a SGI O2 R10000 running Irix 6.3 with gcc I had to
    edit the Makefile: deleting /usr/include from the include-path
    does the trick
