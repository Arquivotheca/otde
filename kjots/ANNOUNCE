Hi !

I have just uploaded a new version (v0.2.2) of kjots to ftp.kde.org
in /pub/kde/apps/Incoming. I expect it will move to /pub/kde/apps/utils.

What is kjots
-------------

Name and idea for this program are taken from the jots program included
in the tkgoodstuff package by Mark Crimmins (markcrim@umich.edu).

Kjots helps you to write down some notes and maybe reduces the stack of
paper lying on your desk.

New in this version
-------------------

- some bug fixes
- please use libkde-0.7.2
- NOTE: please read the file INSTALL even if you upgrade !

Regards.

        Chris.
