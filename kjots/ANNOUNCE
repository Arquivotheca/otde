Hi !

New versions of kjots go directly into the kdeapps distribution.
This is for version 0.2.4.

What is kjots
-------------

Name and idea for this program are taken from the jots program included
in the tkgoodstuff package by Mark Crimmins (markcrim@umich.edu).

Kjots helps you to write down some notes and maybe reduces the stack of
paper lying on your desk.

New in this version
-------------------

- uses kfontdialog to set the font of the editor widget
- you may select an URL in your text and press the right mouse button
  to execute a program with this URL. The program to execute is
  configurable for http and ftp URLs.
- some code cleanup


Regards.

        Chris.
