Hi !

New versions of kjots go directly into the kdeapps distribution.
This is for version 0.2.5.

What is kjots
-------------

Name and idea for this program are taken from the jots program included
in the tkgoodstuff package by Mark Crimmins (markcrim@umich.edu).

Kjots helps you to write down some notes and maybe reduces the stack of
paper lying on your desk.

New in this version
-------------------

- you may save books and pages to an ascii file
- more kde conforming due to the use of KTopLevelWidget


Regards.

        Chris.
