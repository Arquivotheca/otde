Hi !

I have just uploaded a new version (v0.2.3) of kjots to ftp.kde.org
in /pub/kde/apps/Incoming. I expect it will move to /pub/kde/apps/utils.

What is kjots
-------------

Name and idea for this program are taken from the jots program included
in the tkgoodstuff package by Mark Crimmins (markcrim@umich.edu).

Kjots helps you to write down some notes and maybe reduces the stack of
paper lying on your desk.

New in this version
-------------------

- compiles with libkde-970510   NOTE: this version is needed !
- shouldn't segfault, if you delete pages
- double clicking on an entry in the subjectlist closes the subjectlist window
- fixed fonds -> fonts ;)

I'm working on a new version. I just wanted to get this out because
the old version does not compile with the new library.


Regards.

        Chris.
