kjots version 0.2.2

You may distribute kjots under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

kjots is a small note taker program. Name and idea are taken from
the jots program included in the tkgoodstuff package.
The tkgoodstuff package is copyright (C) 1995-96 by Mark Crimmins (markcrim@umich.edu).

You will need libqt-1.2 (maybe qt-1.1 works), libkde-0.7.2 and ktoolpics-0.2 .

The binary is compiled against libqt-1.2 and libkde-0.7.2.
NOTE: If you use libkde-0.7.1 then you may need a patch to libkde that I posted some
time ago. Otherwise kjots won't find its config file. If you use libkde-0.7.2, then
you don't need the patch!
