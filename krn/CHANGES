-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Changed the counter to KBytes, by popular request.
* [Roberto] Faster saving when got many articles from listXover().
            Now the only very slow part is threading (why??).
* [Roberto] Made small incompatible change to the way articles are stored
            Sorry!
* [Roberto] Added more feedback, so krn doesn't look locked.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Made it compatible with Sun again. Several small fixes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Sep 29
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] NNTP Posting. For some reason the articles krn generates don't
  get threaded correctly! (slrn can thread them).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Sep 28
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Added Mail&Post function
* [Roberto] Added Forward function
* [Roberto] Added Post function
* [Roberto] Make composer remember its position. Size doesn't work, because
            it's adjusted manually somewhere.
* [Roberto] Outgoing spool works, now only the network part is missing.
* [Roberto] Played a bit with Krn's web site. New screenshot, showing the
            composer, new toolbar look, new buttons, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Sep 25
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] I *think* krn is now fully KFSSTND compliant.

  Coolo's Automake is next.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 22
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  in the article list.
* [Roberto] Added color selection to article display (I love kcolorbtn!)
* [Roberto] Cleaning up artdlg.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 20
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Implemented Catchup and, "Tagged" menu in groupdlg.
* [Roberto] Cleaning up groupdlg. Fixed a segfault. Changed all loops
  to use iterators (side effects sucked!)
* [Roberto] Fixed several buglets.
* [Roberto] Changed menus in groupdlg, moved "Subscribed" and "Tagged" as
  submenus of Newsgroup. Looks much better this way. Now users shouldn't be
  able to segfault just using menus :-)
* [Roberto] Fixed the empty-newsgroup segfault.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Included all of Stefan Taferner's new kmmessage and friends,
  as well as his new ktablistbox.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 12
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Kinda improved the progress marker. The interface to it sucks
  rocks now. Hopefully it's not used that much.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 9
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


* [Roberto] Implemented "Get messages" command.
* [Roberto] Cleaned groupdlg a little. It's just opinion, though :-)
* [Roberto] Fixed the progress marker to be either accumulative or
  self-resetting, so it gives meaningful info in every case.

-- things above this line are not in the aug 9 release.


* [Roberto] Placed Aug-9 in the web site.
* [Roberto] It's still not too fast, but now the threading code is correct,
  except for the possibility of a reference loop. That should be extremely
  rare, since at least one article would have to know the ID of a message
  that has not been posted yet, but I guess it could be done intentionally
  or by a (very rare) accident.
* [Roberto] Drawed the dialog for visible headers choice.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 8
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Moved the "only unread" option under another menu and made it
  persistant.
* [Roberto] Added font configuration for message display.
* [Roberto] Merging Stefan Taferner's new ktablistbox.
* [Roberto] Added "Get Subjects" command (good for offliners).
* [Roberto] Progress indicator (byte counter) is ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Qt and mime++ rule! I only had to write about 20 lines of code to go from
  an app which was written in a way that apparently prevented this from
  working to one that does it in a very nifty way!
* [Roberto] Removed the horizontal scroller in artdlg, since it was not useful
  and used too much space. (And because now I *can* remove it, thx, Stefan :-)
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Getting missing articles from Altavista works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* [Roberto] Changed the header formatting to make it more compact.

* [Roberto] Small things here and there, preparing for 0.0.3

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Aug 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Threading. It works, but isn't 100% correct.
  I don't think anybody would notice.
  I will rewrite it :-)
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 31
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Kmessage uses the khtmlview. Some cosmetic changes.
* [Roberto] Fixed Dave Mccaney's bug report.
* [Roberto] Placed the hook for threading support.

* [Roberto] Restored links in artdlg.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 28
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Roberto] Just returned, and krn is kinda broken :-(

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 19

* [Magnus] Added article composing dialog (posting still not done)
* [Magnus] Added a hook for searching for lost articles with Altavista

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 9
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Magnus]  Added support for plug-in decoders

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 8
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Magnus]  Added support for plug-in formatters.
* [Roberto] Changed KDecode. The design was fairly braindead. Now it's just
            slightly silly.
* [Roberto] Changing the headers in articlelist & starting work in the
            scorer/killer.
* [Magnus]  Added content-decoding, and fixed a bug.
* [Roberto] Polishing things so krn fits in the CVS tree.
* [Roberto] Now changes will indicate who made them.
* [Sander]  Added read/unread switch
* [Sander]  Several bugs regarding mailgroup handling and stuff fixed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Basically, implemented binary decoding. Very powerful!
* Releasing today as 0.0.2, so more people see what's going on.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 6
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Made online/offline modes more useful.
* Added a "Should connect?" dialog for operations that need a connection
* If you open a group and you are connected, it gets a list of new articles.
  (the empty window was a little confusing ;-)
* Made cute about dialog. And I mean *cute*.
* The decoding support is almost done. I'm gonna do some code reuse and
  make a small main() so that a Kdecode can be built. Two apps for the
  price of one! 8-)
* Implemented article saving.
* Now, as soon as I have attachment saving going, I'll release 0.0.2, put krn
  in the CVS tree, and have a beer (or two) (or a dozen)!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed yet another bug in the group list (and it was a hard one!)
* Got Magnus's Kmessage::tNG (merged)
* Fixed a couple of bugs reported by Stephan Kulow. One of them is still there.
* Hyperlinked references work!
* Working on nicer binary decoding.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 3

* Arranged everything so that krn can be built using just kdesupport.
* Decoding of simple stuff
* Some new keybindings by Sander Alberink
* Bug in NNTP::Open() fixed (thanks Sander)
* Several other small things
* New release

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed slightly the formatting of the References: header in Kmessage
* I'm working in the mime++/kdesupport/cvs/mimelib thingie, and hating every
  minute of it :-/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jul 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* More fixes to the group list.
* Implemented group tagging.
* Touched up xpms in general (now all are the same size) and created a
  "tagged" xpm. They are still not really good, but it's better.
* Fixed xpm loading. Now krn works from any dir after instaling.
* Got Magnus's new KMessage with decoding support!
* I'm trying to integrate uulib into krn's tree.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 30
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed yet another bug in the scrollbars.
* Fixed INN's 'mode reader' peculiarity AGAIN.
* Implemented the AUTHINFO command (THERE YOU HAVE IT BERND! 8-).
* Implemented RMB-popup in group list.
* Fixed the broken hyperlink to other groups.
* Fixed a few things in the group list window. It's quite nice now (IMHO).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 29
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* I am determined to make those damn scrollbars behave.
  I think they do now.
* Started with menus/config-dialogs/buttons/keybindings/etc.
  Now krn has working Identity and NNTP config dialogs.
  Also, if you haven't configured before, asks the necessary data at startup.
* Implementing authentication (Not done yet).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 28
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Improved krn's home page a little (GIMP 0.99 is niiiiiiiiice)
* Saw Tyson-Holyfield. Tasty ear, Mike? yuck!
* Ok, not much, but really the Jun 27 changes ended around 5AM today ;-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Made the Article class garbage collecting, and shared among every
  article list in krn. It's neat (IMHO), but there seems to be a memory leak
  somewhere. Honestly, I have no clue as how to find it. ps is not very
  precise, really.
* Now.... Krn has memory!!!! It remembers if you read an article.
  You can find it on another group, or on another server, and it will still
  remember it.
* Krn compiles with the mew mime++
* General code clean up.
* Totally new NNTP code!
* BIG memory leaks plugged!
  (but there is still a 400K leak every time a group opens :-| )
* whoa, this is starting to look like a newsreader!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 26
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* I am doing serious changes to the data structures, trying to clean up
  everything. It's working so far.
* Today is memory leak plugging day!
* Magnus made a new KMessage (now it has scrollbars! :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 25
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ARGGGGGGHHHHH! People hate me! And they are right! The Jun-24 pakage
  overwrites some pixmaps used by kfm! if you "make install".
  Fixed (kindof). My most sincere apologies. I replaced the package with the
  fixed one. SORRY,SORRY,SORRY!
* Changed KMessage's URL generation to make Kurl happy
  BTW: Kurl isMalformed is too picky, since news:/group.name is
  a valid URL with protocol news, hostname unspecified,path group.name
  Now it's news://servername/group.name instead of news:/group.name
* Now if you click on a newsgroup name in a message header, the right group
  opens. It's neat!. And in the process I fixed a huge memory leak :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 24
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Included Magnus Reftel's improved KMessage, so now, Magnus, you are
  officially a krn developer ;)
* Now krn compiles again. That's no small change methinks.
* Now it uses the NewsGroup class, it's time to flesh it.
* Fixed bug in Article::formHeader() [ I hope nobody have mail addresses over
  2048 bytes ]
* Stephan Kulow just reported what hopefully will be the last false "no xover"
  bug.
* Krn is now officially going to be included in kdeapps (Thx, Stephan!)
* I think I fixed all bugs getting the group and article lists. I also think
  I'm an optimist.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 23
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed stupid bug in main.cpp which by chance didn't show on my box.
  My fault! (Thanks Bernd).
* Started to implement the Newsgroup class. (This is big)
* Updated the README acording to Stefan Kulow's suggestion
* Now if you don't set NNTPSERVER krn gives a nice warning before dying
* I switched to the latest KIconloader and now no icon loads ARGHHHHH!
  I'll just leave this commented and try when a new KIconLoader appears.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 22
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* If I told you, I would have to kill you! :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 21
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Small bug in Kmessage (background color not resetted) fixed.
* Fairly large bug in header display fixed.
* Display of addresses in the header list normalized with DwMailbox.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 20
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Now krn does autoconf!!!. This should allow integration into the kdeapps
  package. The problem was not autoconf, it was that I was too stupid to go
  get the latest kexample.
* Some code cleanup. Now the only warning using gcc -Wall is in
  ktablistbox.cpp, and that's Stefan's code, so I consider myself innocent ;)
* (METACHANGES) Changed the "Changes made Jun 13" section, I got Bernd
  Wuebben's name wrong :-) Credit given where credit is due.... 
* I made a linux based terminal server that fits in a floppy (no HD required,
  as the QNX demo says). I know, nothing to do with krn, but it took quite
  some time, and it's very neat 8-)
* I'm testing Magnus's new network code.
* Announced Krn's (un)impressive home page at http://ultra7.unl.edu.ar/krn
  in the KDE list.
* Started looking at KIconLoader to fix the pixmap problems. Sadly, the latest
  kdelibs won't compile for me, so I'm not sure the docs I have match the
  class in my installed libs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed the Makefile to clean the mimepp directory
* Fixed the historic "this fuction may return with/without a value" warning
  Now krn compiles without warnings on gcc -W. gcc -Wall is another story.
* After Stefan Kulow asked if he could include this on kdeapps, I'm looking
  again at the autoconf stuff. I guess my brain doesn't match with it,
  because it makes absolutely no sense to me :-( I'll try harder.
* Tested it with the "stable" KDE release, and didn't found any difference.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 18
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Small patch for INN servers that need the "mode reader" command
* Fixed a bug in the NNTP::artList() function for small groups
* Not much, but today was the KDE IRC gathering

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 17
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Implemented 2 new keybindings in artDlg: Space/BackSpace, to page down and
  up in the message window.
* Start implementing at least basic menus. Krn looks very stupid without them.
  Now at least you can exit without killing the window.
* Use DwDateTime from mime++ to parse the message date and print it in a
  consistent way (even if ugly).
* Now Kmessage uses the mime++ library.
  It understands simple and multipart messages, as well as text/plain and
  text/html mimetypes!
  It's also fairly solid (no segfaults that I could see)
  Just remember: never store the result of a DwSomething.Function()
  or it will segfault sooner or later, and will take hours to track :-(.
* Fixed a silly bug in Artdlg::fillTree (I forgot to clear the article list
  before loading the new one)
* Fixed yet another 2 stupid warnings that showed up when I changed gcc to g++
* Modified the Makefile to let mime++ build as part of krn's building
  process. It's much neater this way.
* All things considered, a good day of work!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 16
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Integrated Stefan's new ktablistbox widget.
  Seems to have a small problem with D&D (it leaves droppings all over the
  place :-)
* Planning how to use MIME++, which seems to be a cute library that's
  gonna save me a lot of work.
* Same thing for uulib, part of uudeview.
* Downloaded Socket++ lib, but it's probably not worth it.
* Ok, it wasn't much, but it's monday and a holiday here, so it *feels*
  like sunday :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 15
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Come on! It's Sunday!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 14
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Improved artdlg header box. Put separators and pixmaps.
* Added formHeader method to the Article class, that returns a formatted
  line to put in the article list.
* Added read and available status to the Article class.
* Rewrote Groupdlg::fillTree
  Now it only inserts the items in the newsgroup tree when you expand
  the branch. It still doesn't remove them when you collapse, so branching
  slows down after you open a lot of branches, but ....
  This REALLY improved startup time (It's very fast now!).
  As a bonus, this fillTree function is much nicer than the old one.
  Even I can understand it! :-)
  Now, the new openGroup function... Nah, it's not nearly as ugly.
* Fixed a couple of silly warnings.
* Found a bug: when a group contains no articles, getting the article list
  causes a segfault.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes made Jun 13
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Followed Bernd Wuebben suggestion to speed up groupList.
* Changed the ktreelist to a ktablistbox in artdlg.
* Added a "Check for unread articles" button in groupdlg.
  It's still a broken, since I don't mark articles read, and don't count
  the cache, so it's more of a "Articles available on server" button.
* All buttons in artdlg do something now, if even say "Not implemented"
* Added keyboard shortcuts in artdlg to allow keyboard-only navigation:
	n=next article
        p=previous article
        g=get article list
        f=post followup
        r=reply by mail
* Started the Changelog ;-)
