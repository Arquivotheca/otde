INTRODUCTION:
*************************************************************************

This is the third release of KRN, a news reader for the KDE project.
It doesn't do much yet, but it lets you connect to a server, 
subscribe/unsubscribe to newsgroups, and even read them (sometimes :-).

Krn is under the GPL, so it comes with no warranty, etc,etc.
Read the COPYING file if you want the lawyerspeak.

*************************************************************************
NEW ON THIS VERSION
*************************************************************************

Well, I don't really remember, but I think this list is more-or-less
adequate:

* Threading (not 100% correct I'm afraid)
* Article printing
* Option to see all/unread articles
* Binary file decoding
* Better installation
* Preliminary preview of posting support (guaranteed to crash)
* Nice icon, courtesy of Nico Schirwing
* Lots o'bugfixing
* Compiles with all the latest libs

*************************************************************************
IMPORTANT:
*************************************************************************

1) Krn needs a server that supports the XOVER extension, which should
   be almost every server out there which is not *very* outdated.
   BUT there seems to be a problem with krn's detection of XOVER support
   so if krn gives you a "your server doesn't support XOVER" error, let me
   know, and we can check out if that's really true.

3) I really need testers. Krn works quite well for me, but some people have
   BIG problems. So, don't just throw it away, become a developer!
   Debug and win fame and fortune! 8-)

4) krn has a web page at: http://ultra7.unl.edu.ar/krn where you can get the
   latest/greatest/buggiest version of krn almost every day.

5) krn uses the very excellent and generally nice MIME++ library developed
   by Doug Sauder <dwsauder@fwb.gulf.net> with the author's permission. 


**************************************************************************
NOT SO IMPORTANT:

The biggest unimplemented things are:

* Posting

(wow! this list has gotten a lot shorter! :-)

If you want help... look at the tooltips :-).

PS: it should compile fine on other OSs, but I only tested it on Linux.
