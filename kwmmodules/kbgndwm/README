KBGNDWM
-------

Desktop background manager.

kbgndwm is responsible for setting the current desktop selected using kwm.
It requires kwm2 to function correctly.  To install kbgndwm add:

kbgwndwm &

to your .xinitrc before kwm.


The only configuration option in kbgndwmrc is

[General]
CacheSize=512


Where CacheSize is the maximum memory to be used for caching backgrounds.
A larger cache size means that the backgrounds switch faster.  Fastest
background switching is achieved when all backgrounds fit in the cache.
It is therefore advised that flat, gradient, or small tiled images are
used rather than a large, scaled or centred image.
