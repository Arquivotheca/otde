KPager
------
							The kwm pager.


KPager is a program that shows you a small view of all your desktops
and lets you see at a glanze all your windows and applications, it
also allows you to change their position, desktop, sticky state, etc.

KPager reads your kbgndwm configuration and shows each desktop's
background with its corresponding image, gradient, etc.

It also uses xdnd to move windows across desktops.

Now it also has a totally new mode to work which has never been seen 
in any u**x machine ! . The Pixmap draw mode . Try it !


TODO

Help (really needed ?)

   reading kbgndwm configuration, etc.
