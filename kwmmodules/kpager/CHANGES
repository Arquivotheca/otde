KPager now has a one-click way to work
It also highlights the window the cursor is over (not very useful right
now but will become useful next week :) )
It has some big bug fixes (they caused a core dump when setting the sticky bits
in some cases and a bug in the handling of stacking order )

Updated kpager to the new kbgndwm configure style
I still have to implement the new kbgndwm draw modes, but the
old ones already work

The arrow buttons now move whole desktop view when clicked and
still scrolls the view when pressed for a while (but faster than before)
as suggested by David Faure
Now a single click on a free area activates the desktop and also a double
click anywhere (just in case you don't have a free area)
