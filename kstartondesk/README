                  ============================
 Developed and maintained by Matthias Ettrich (ettrich@kde.org)


kstartondesk is a tiny tool which allows to launch applications 
on certain desktops.

I still have no idea why this is useful, since the session manager
already restores application where they have been. But since people
requested this feature over and over again I hacked it together.
Anyway it would be nice if somebody could tell me a real reason, why
this is useful at all :)

Usage is simple. If you want a kcalc with Caption "Calc" started on 
desktop 3, simply type

      kstartondesk "kcalc -caption \"Calc\" " "Calc" 3 

The syntax is
 
      kstartondesk [-version] [-activate] command title desktop 

Note that it is not possible to determine the process ID of a certain
window under X. So kstartondesk has to use the window caption for this
(similar to kpanel´s swallowing). For that reason the title-argument
must match the windows title exactly.

If the "-activate"-switch is set then kwm will jump to the specified
virtual desktop and give the focus to the new window.


kstartondesk depends the kwm windowmanager.
