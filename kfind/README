Alpha Version 0.3

KFind
=====

Kfind is frontend for utility find inspired by find utility from NT. 

At this time it is fully functional. All in kfind available options
are working. You can save the results, delete, change properties of
found files/dirs, store them to archive and ask kfm for opening dir
containing this file or execute default binding.

From previous version kfind uses libkdeui so widgets kmgsbox and ktabctl
were removed from kfind distribution.

Compilation 
----------- 

It is necessary to set the QTDIR and KDEDIR enviroment variables.
Then you have to install libkde(>=0.7) and kfm(>=0.5.8)!!! (unless you
installed them already). It is also necessary to patch ktabctl widget
in libkde (otherwise there could be sometimes problems by resizing!).
Appropriate patch is available in file ktabctl.patch.  Finally you can
simply do ./configure, make and make install. Copy
$KDEDIR/lib/kfind/config/kfindrc to file ~/.kfindrc (this will enable
you to store files to tar archives).

[Maintainer's note: the aforementioned patch has been included in
kdelibs-0.8, so you do not need it any longer. -kalle] 

TODO
----

 o enable changing filetypes and archivers details in preferences dialog
 o write better widget for viewing results which would enable multiple
   selection
 o and more ...

BUGS
----
Probably many :-(( So if you find then it would be helpful
to send me message.

THANKS 
------ 

I want to thank Alexander Sanda <alex@darkstar.ping.at> for making
KTabCtl and KMsgBox widgets which are used in Kfind and Torben Weis
<weis@stud.uni-frankfurt.de> for his wonderful filemanager kfm.


I hope you will find this program somehow useful and I would
appreciate any suggestions and comments.
