KFind
=====

Kfind is a frontend for the utility `find' inspired by the find
utility from NT.

At this time it is fully functional. All options available in kfind
are working. You can save the results, delete, change properties of
found files/directories, store them to an archive and ask kfm to open
the directory containing this file or execute default binding.

From version 0.2.9 kfind uses libkdeui so the widgets kmgsbox and ktabctl
were removed from kfind distribution.

Compilation 
----------- 

It is necessary to set the environment variables QTDIR and KDEDIR.
Then you have to install latest libkde and kfm!!! (unless you
installed them already). Then you can simply do ./configure, make and
make install. 

BUGS
----
Probably many :-(( So if you find then it would be helpful
to send me a message.

THANKS 
------ 

I want to thank Alexander Sanda <alex@darkstar.ping.at> for making
KTabCtl and KMsgBox widgets which are used in Kfind and Torben Weis
<weis@stud.uni-frankfurt.de> for his wonderful filemanager kfm.


I hope you will find this program somehow useful and I would
appreciate any suggestions and comments.
