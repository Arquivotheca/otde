This directory contains files contributed by RosettaMan users.  These
files are not supported or installed.  They are included because some
may find them useful, and if so they prevent duplication of effort.

* sutter.txt - "Edward L. Sutter" <els@sage.sage.att.com>

"...converting "man" directories with their typical sub-directories of
man1, man2, etc... to an equivalently structured "html" directory with
the same sub-directory heirarchy."

"I added an option to rman that allows it to search for the files over
a specified set of directories.  This allows (for example) manpages under
man1 that reference something under man3 to be properly linked."

--

* man2html - Marc Donner (donner@fid.morgan.com)

A Korn Shell script that is moderately generic.  It takes all the
files in a directory or a set of directories and does them one at a
time, putting the html output somewhere appropriate.  The only
infelicity in the script is the stuff with localeo (local electronic
office) which is a hack put together to tweak the URLs not to refer to
localhost, which is broken right now, but directly to the local
server's alias.

---

* sco-wrapper.sh - Dag Nygren <dag@newtech.fi>

SCO puts the names of valid man page sections in the file /etc/default/man.
This wrapper extracts the names from this file and passes them on to 
RosettaMan for use in determining man page cross references.

---

* http-rman.{c,html} - Fredrik Lundh <fredrik@kalle.teragon.ivab.se>

An HTTP server using RosettaMan to produce hypertext renditions of
man-pages on the fly.
