KDE Screen Saver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an alpha release of screen savers for KDE.  The timeout stuff is
based on a very heavily modified xautolock.
You should get kdisplay also.


Features:

Each screen saver is a stand-alone executable.
Each screen saver has a setup dialog.
Interfaces with kdisplay, so no manual setup of screen saver is necessary.
Hotspots in corners of display to invoke saver/locker.
Copy kscreensaver.h/cpp to your app and call kForceLock() to lock the
 screen any time.
or just run klock


Installation:

You will require libkde-0.7.1 or higher

1. Create a KDEDIR environment variable, e.g. /usr/local/kde
2. Type make
3. If you DO NOT have shadow passwords type: make install
   If you   DO   have shadow passwords type: make install-shadow


Adding New Screensavers:

To add your own screen savers you must provide four functions:

void startScreenSaver( Drawable d );

  Start the screen saver in the specified window if it is not currently
  running.

void stopScreenSaver();

  Stop the screen saver if it is currently running.

int  setupScreenSaver();

  Display a dialog so the the user can change the screen saver settings.

const char *getScreenSaverName()

  return the name/description of the screen saver


All drawing must be done in Xlib.
use blankscrn.*, polygon.* and banner.* as examples.
Naming the screensavers *.kss allows kdisplay to locate the available
screensavers.

TODO:

More screen savers - If you plan to write/port a screen saver, please let
  me know what you are doing so that effort is not duplicated.
Support multiple screens - I can't do this - I only have one.
