	* bsod.cpp (BSODSaver::BSODSaver): initialize the random seed correctly.

	* amiga.xpm, atari.xbm, bsod.cpp, bsod.h, mac.xbm, AUTHORS, Makefile.am:
	New screensaver: BSOD.  Yay!  Still needs some final polishing however (such as a

	* saver.h: Add correct C style prototypes for startScreenSaver and friends.

	* main.cpp: Make startScreenSaver and friends use C style name mangling.
