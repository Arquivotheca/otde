Hi,

> You take the award for most options in a

I have plenty of others in mind...
But don't panic...

this is a new version
  - providing a gif image which is shown in the preview widget
    (the user might have an empty desktop)
  - 'niced' prepare dialog (also a little gif)
  - some small bugfixes
  
the gifs should go to (kdedir)/share/apps/kscreensaver, but I don't
know how to set up the makefiles for this purpose. sorry for the 
inconvenience...

greets,
rene beutler


btw: do you remember my patch for the password dialog,
     which showed the stars when typing? I liked this
     interaction. what do you think?
