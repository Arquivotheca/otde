<P><B>Kfind</B> is designed to help find files within a directory hierarchy.
i.e if you know that a file is 'out there somewhere' but don't know exactly
where it is, then <B>kfind</B> is the tool for you. Having found the
required file(s), you can save, delete, change file properties, store them
to archives and/ or open the directory containing the file in the file
manager (<B>Kfm</B>)</P>

<P>I hope you will find this program somehow useful and I would
appreciate any suggestions and comments.</P>
