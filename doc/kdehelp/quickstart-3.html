<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Folder Windows - managing your files</A></H2>



<P>If you are accustomed to usual Unix file managers, forget
everything you learned about them. File managers in the UNIX area are
little programs which are started on demand, providing an overview
over the file system and allowing to copy, move and rename files,
creating directories etc. Sometimes they are able to run applications
or start an application to open some document. These were the old UNIX
days. Today the user expects more. The computer industry is moving
towards a network computer interface where it does not matter, where on
the world a file is located. The file manager should act the same on all
resources no matter where they are located. We will come back to this
interesting topic in the next section.</P>


<P>A very important improvement of today's desktops is the folder metaphor.
Every directory on your hard disk is represented as a folder to you.
A folder is displayed in a window, showing you an icon for every file
in the folder. Well, if you ever used Mac, Win95 or OS/2 you will know
what I mean. If you started KDE for your first time you will notice
that there is a window with lots of icons in it. This is the folder
representing your home directory (this is your current directory after
logging into your computer). Since KDE supports session management, it
saves the position and several other attributes of every open
application at logout time. This means that you see the same windows
that were opened while you logged out when you log back in.</P>


<P>Let's return to the folder window. It contains a set of icons and it is
a good idea to click with the right mouse button on such an icon. You
will see a popup menu that allows you to copy, move and delete the
file, move it to the trash, open its properties dialogs or start some
application to open the document and much more. KDE has a set of so
called MIME-types. (MIME is an acronym for "Multimedia Internet Mail
Extension", but if you did not know that by know you probably do not
need to know it at all.) They tell KDE which icon it should use for
which kind of file. Please notice that there is no need to edit long
configuration files to get all these pretty icons. Every KDE
application which needs new MIME types and other stuff should come with 
preconfigured config files and icons (since this is a beta, and not a
final version, this might not be the case everywhere; please send a
bug report if you notice any omissions). What I wanted to express:
Everything should work out of the box. If you have installed e.g.
the KDE postscript viewer, then KDE knows which icon to use for postscript
files and which application can handle them. As a result, you can just
press the left mouse button over an icon, and KDE tries to find an
appropriate application. If that is not the case, KDE will ask you for
one. It may happen that you have installed several apps for the same kind
of data. In this case, they are all listed in the popup menu discussed
above. In another part of KDE documentation, you will learn how to set
a default application if several apps installed for images for
example.</P>
<P> </P>

<P>Now you know that KDE can deal with files and directories, copy,
move and delete them and many other nifty things. KDE can open
documents for you. On a properly installed KDE, you don't need to know
which app is needed to do so.</P>
<P> </P>

<P>KDE supports drag and drop in many places. We will talk more about this
later. Right now you should notice that every icon in KDE's folder windows
can be dragged out of the folder window and be deposited on the desktop.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Archives and Networks</A></H2>



<P>As mentioned in the previous chapter, networks are becoming more
and more important. In the near past, you needed a couple of
applications to deal with files which are distributed all over the
world. KDE supports a technology that is called "Network Transparent
Access" (NTA) which means that the user does not have to worry about
the location of some file. KDE will do the same no matter whether the 
file is on the other side of the earth or on your local hard disk.</P>


<P>The KDE folder window can not only show you the content of usual
directories. The directory content on an ftp server is displayed in
such a window as well. Perhaps you are used to the WinZip(tm) utility
on MS-Windows(tm), then you will be happy to hear that KDE can look
into tar archives, too. The content of such an archive is displayed in
a folder window as well. You won't notice a difference between them
(well, since the internet is slow, you will notice that ftp
directories will show up much slower than local ones, but that is
not KDE's fault :-)</P>


<P>Clicking for example on an image on some ftp server will start your
favourite image viewer. KDE retrieves the file from the web for you
and starts your image viewer afterwards. For example "oldies" like XV
become internet aware this way! Until there is not yet a KDE
application for your purposes (though there are already KDE
applications for many tasks, and many more a currently written), you
can let old applications make use of NTA simply by providing some
configuration. We'll tell you how to do this later on the
documentation.</P>
<P> </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Icons - drag and drop</A></H2>



<P>We already talked about icons a lot. Right now we had a look at
them if they appeared in folder windows. But icons may as well appear
on the background of the desktop, too. This feature is well known from
most modern desktops like OS/2(tm) and Macintosh(tm). I think you are
not surprised if I tell you that icons on the background of your
desktop behave like the ones in the folder. Clicking on them forces
the same actions to happen, the context sensitive popup menu is the
same and so on. There is only a little difference: You can position
them at will. Icons in a folder window are sorted by name, you can not
save their positions which is why KDE does not allow you user specific
placement of icons in folder windows yet.</P>


<P>You can do many nice things with drag'n'drop. For example, let's
say you have an icon representing an application (this icon may be in
the folder window, on the panel or on the background of your
desktop). When you drop another icon which represents a file on it,
the application starts up and opens the files you dropped on
it. Similarly, you can drop icons over a folder icon. This will copy,
move or link (KDE will ask you what you want) these files in the
folder. Please remember that files can be represented by any URL, not
just local filenames. /home/weis/docu.txt is as valid as
<CODE>http://www.kde.org.</CODE></P>


<P>Many people don't know that they are also allowed to drag icons
which represent applications, printers etc. on the panel. This
results in a new button on the panel. This button will of course
reappear after logging out and logging in again. In addition to
application and printers, the KDE link files (sometimes referred to as
kdelnk files or "desktop entries") can represent almost everything
from WWW sites, over applications to printers; you have many many
possibilities to explore. If you link an URL on your desktop, KDE
creates such a kdelnk file for you on the fly. The extension "kdelnk"
is hidden, since it does not look very nice. Therefore, kdelnk files
look like usual icons. Prominent kdelnk files are for example the
floppy and cdrom icon that we will discuss now.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Mounting your devices</A></H2>



<P>"To mount a device" means that you e.g. add the content of your cdrom
to your directory tree. Unlike MS-Windows, UNIX has one big directory tree
that contains every device. If you click on such a device icon,
KDE will try to mount the device and opens the directory this 
device is mounted on. For example after mounting the cdrom on my system
the directory "/cd" shows up. With a right click on a device button
you get the option to unmount the device again. Unless you unmount it,
you are not allowed to remove the disk or cdrom. To get this automatic
mount feature to work, your /etc/fstab must allow users to mount/unmount
this device. Later chapters will show you what has to be done; you
could also consult the documentation of your OS vendor.</P>
