<h1>Introduction To The Desktop -- KDE Quick Start</h1>

<p><font size=+1>NOTE: This document is neither complete nor
finished. It is a quick and dirty hack for the very first
beta release (aka "Arnsberg"). We will provide a better documentation
before KDE 1.0. If you are interested in working as an author in the
KDE documentation project, please contact <a
href="mailto:kalle@kde.org">kalle@kde.org</a></font></p>  

<p>This short introduction is meant as an assistance to help you
getting used to the KDE Desktop Environment. To keep it small and
simple, this guide is far from covering all topics or even most of
them. It will only describe the basic or default ways to accomplish a
few of the most common tasks and also gives some hints on what is
possible. Please keep in mind that many of the described things can be
customized easily within the KDE to fit your personal taste, which is
explained in the additional and more detailed documentation.</p>

<p>We also assume in this guide that you are already familiar with
some graphical user interface, as for example CDE(tm), Geos(tm),
GEM(tm), NeXT(tm), MacFinder(tm), Presentation Manager(tm) or
MS-Windows(tm). So we will not explain the usage of a mouse or the
single keys of your keyboard but concentrate on hopefully less boring
things.</p> 

<h2>Let there be some windows -- how to launch an application</h2>

<p>On the bottom of the screen you find the desktop panel, simply
referred to as panel in the future. Among other purposes the panel is
the first choice if you want to launch an application. Have a look on
the button on the left which shows the two gears. This button is
called the "Go!" button. It has a small arrow on the top to indicate
that it will pop up a menu if you click on it. Just do it! The popup
is called the "Go!" menu and offers you easy-click-access to all
applications which are installed on your computer system. With Mod1-F1
(Mod1 is probably mapped to the Alt-key on a standard PC keyboard
setting; we will assume that this is the case in the remainder of this
document; if Mod1 is remapped to something else, just use that key
instead of Alt) you also have fast keyboard access to this "Go!" menu.</p>

<p>There are other interesting things possible with this panel. One
may be important if you have a low-resolution on your monitor, it is
the "hide-and-show"-function: Try to click onto the small button with
the "K"-Label! (By the way, if you are not sure what a certain button
does in KDE, just move the mouse pointer over it and wait for a short
while: KDE has a built-in mini context help, so-called "tooltips",
which explain the functionality of such controls in a few words.</p>

<p>But let us put all these details on hold for a moment and start an
application instead (for example the already mentioned "Find Utility")
and have a look how to manipulate windows in KDE.</p>

<h2>A window! What now?</h2>

<p>Usually, people work <em>inside</em> windows, but sometimes you may
want to manipulate windows, for example</p>
<ul>
<li>maximize a window
<li>iconify a window (i.e. make it invisible except for a little icon)
<li>move a window
<li>resize a window
<li>switch between windows (meaning you deactivate one and activate
another) 
</ul>

<p>Moving and resizing is easy: Just take the window with the mouse at
the titlebar to move it around or drag the window border to resize. As
special gimmick you can also move a window around when you keep the
Alt-Key down and start the drag  
with the left mouse button *anywhwere* in the entire window. The same
applies for resizing a window if you use the right mouse button.</p>  

<p>More exiting are the various extra buttons at the top of a window:
KDE windows have some pretty standard buttons on their titlebar which
give you fast access to some common operations. The default button
layout looks like this:</p> 

<p>On the left side:</p>
<ul>
<li>a menu button. This usually also shows a pretty mini icon. Click
on it to get a window specific window operations menu. You can also
get this window with Alt-F3 if you prefer the keyboard.

<li>a sticky button. To pin the window onto the screen. What the heck
is this supposed to mean? Will be explained below &mdash; stay tuned!
</ul>


<p>On the right side:</p>
<ul>
<li>an iconify button. An iconified window is no longer visible on the
screen, but has still an entry on the windowlist or the taskbar. It
can easily be restored again.

<li>maximize. Compared to other graphical user interfaces this
maximize button has some neat extra functionality: If you click on it
with the middle mouse button, then the window will only be resized
vertically, with the right mouse button only horizontally.

<li>a button with an "X" on it. This kind of button has a moving
history. Originally defined in the NeXT(tm) system it had the meaning
of "maximize". Unfortunatly Windows 95(tm) redefined the meaning as
"Close". Since virtually every graphical user system since then used
an X-like symbol for the close button (among them the Presentation
Manager (tm), Limbo(tm) and some former attempts for graphical user
interfaces on top of the X Window System), the KDE also uses the
"X"-Button to indicate "Close". The keyboard shortcut for this button
is Alt-F4. 
</ul>

<p>Now that we know how to deal with windows we encourage you to open
some windows with the panel since we will now reveal the secret how to
switch between different windows.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this. The most simple way is to click
into the new window (Depending on your desktop settings you might have
to click on the title bar or the border to make this work, but you can
also hold Alt while clicking into the window; this will activate the
window no matter how your desktop is configured.) An advanced way is
to use the keyboard for that (try Alt-Tab or Control-Escape for this
purpose). An advanced way for mouse users is to use the taskbar. In
the default KDE setup the taskbar is located in the top left corner,
but it can also be located at the top or the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>The taskbar is very powerful: A simple click with the left mouse
button on the appropriate taskbutton will bring you to your
application immediately. The middle mouse button also allows you to
iconify/deiconify a window, And, last but not least, the right mouse
button will pop up a context menu, as usual. This menu is quite
similar to the window operations menu of the window itself and allows
you to do various operations with the window.</p>

<p>If you are coming from a UNIX/X11 background you may perhaps also
enjoy a windowlist on kpanel (Go!->Panel->Add Windowlist) or on the
background (which is also called the "root window" in the X Window
System) if you click on it with the middle mouse button.</p>


<h2>An aside: Putting launch buttons on the panel</h2> 
<p>If you use one application or tool very often, then you may want to
have even faster access to it, of course. In this case, you can add a
single application or an entire submenu of the "start"-menu as a special
quick-launch button onto the panel. If you want to reach the "Find
Utility" directly via a launch button , simply choose
Go!->Panel->Add Application->Find Utility (By this syntax we mean that
you should first pop up the Go! menu by clicking on the Go! button,
then select "Panel" where the small arrow to the right indicates that
another menu will pop up. In this menu, choose "Add application" and
in the next submenu "Find Utility".). Note that you can move all
items of the panel around with the "move" command of the context
menu. Just click with the third mouse button (the third mouse button
is normally the right button, but if you have configured your mouse
for lefthanders e.g., it might also be the left one). A menu will pop
up where ou can choose "Move". Now move the mouse and see how the icon
follows while still staying on the panel. When you are done, simply
hit the first mouse button (by default the left one). As you have may
have noticed, there is also a menu entry "Remove" in case you are
tired of a certain launch button on your desktop.</p>

<p>This leads us to another interesting topic: KDE usually offers a
context menu on the right mouse button whereever this is useful. It is
therefore always a good idea to try out the thirf mouse button on
something, if you do not know what to do with it. Even the background
of the desktops has such a menu!</p> 


<h2>Now, what was that "sticky" thing?</h2>

<p>It may happen that you have more windows open than space on your
desktops. In this case 
you have three possibilities:</p>
<ol> 
<li> let all windows open (confusing!)
<li> Iconify those windows which you do not need at present and use
the taskbar or Alt-Tab to switch between them (still a bit confusing
and much work!) 
<li> Recommended: Do what a real operation system does if there is not
enough physical memory: Use virtual memory, in this case virtual
desktops. 
</ol>

<p>Item 3 is the way to go! KDE can handle several different
desktops. You can switch between the virtual desktops very easily with
a click on one of the (default: 4) desktop buttons of kpanel. Also
Control-F1...F8 will send you to the desktop immediatly. (There is
also a way similar to the switching of windows, here with Control-Tab).</p> 

<p>Virtual desktops are very nice. But sometimes you want a window to
be present on *every* desktop. This could be for example a small chat
window or a alarm clock or whatever. In this case you can use the
above menioned "sticky"-button which will pin the window on the
background so that it will occur on every virtual desktop.</p> 

<p>This can also be used to move a window from one virtual desktop to
another one. But it is easier if you use the context popup menu of the
current window (menu item "Onto current desktop") or the "Send to"
submenu of the window operations popup of a certain window.</p> 


<h2>Folder Windows - managing your files</h2>

<p>If you are accustomed to usual Unix file managers, forget
everything you learned about them. File managers in the UNIX area are
little programs which are started on demand, providing an overview
over the file system and allowing to copy, move and rename files,
creating directories etc. Sometimes they are able to run applications
or start an application to open some document. These were the old UNIX
days. Today the user expects more. The computer industry is moving
towards a network computer interface where it does not matter, where on
the world a file is located. The file manager should act the same on all
resources no matter where they are located. We will come back to this
interesting topic in the next section.</p>

<p>A very important improvement of today's desktops is the folder metapher.
Every directory on your hard disk is represented as a folder to you.
A folder is displayed in a window, showing you an icon for every file
in the folder. Well, if you ever used Mac, Win95 or OS/2 you will know
what I mean. If you started KDE for your first time you will notice
that there is a window with lots of icons in it. This is the folder
representing your home directory (this is your current directory after
logging into your computer). Since KDE supports session management, it
saves the position and several other attributes of every open
application at logout time. This means that you see the same windows
that were opened while you logged out when you log back in.</p>

<p>Let's return to the folder window. It contains a set of icons and it is
a good idea to click with the right mouse button on such an icon. You
will see a popup menu that allows you to copy, move and delete the
file, move it to the trash, open its proerties dialogs or start some
application to open the document and much more. KDE has a set of so
called MIME-types. (MIME is an acronym for "Multimedia Internet Mail
Extension", but if you did not know that by know you probably do not
need to know it at all.) They tell KDE which icon it should use for
which kind of file. Please notice that there is no need to edit long
configuration files to get all these pretty icons. Every KDE
application which needs new MIME types and other stuff should come with 
preconfigured config files and icons (since this is a beta, and not a
final version, this might not be the case everywhere; please send a
bug report if you notice any omissions). What I wanted to express:
Everything should work out of the box. If you have installed e.g.
the KDE postscript viewer, then KDE knows which icon to use for postscript
files and which application can handle them. As a result, you can just
press the left mouse button over an icon, and KDE tries to find an
appropriate application. If none is found, KDE will ask you for
one. It may happen that you have installed several apps for the same kind
of data. In this case, they are all listed in the popup menu discussed
above. In another part of KDE documentation, you will learn how to set
a default application if several apps installed for images for
example.</p> 

<p>Now you know that KDE can deal with files and directories, copy,
move and delete them and many other nifty things. KDE can open
documents for you. On a properly installed KDE, you dont need to know
which app is needed to do so.</p> 

<p>KDE supports drag'n'drop in many places. We will talk more about this
later. Right now you should notice that every icon in KDE's folder windows
can be dragged out of the folder window and be deposited on the desktop.</p>

<h3>Archives and Networks</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, networks are becoming more
and more important. In the near past, you needed a couple of
applications to deal with files which are distributed all over the
world. KDE supports a technology that is called "Network Transparent
Access" (NTA) which means that the user does not have to worry about
the location of some file. KDE will do the same no matter whether the 
file is on the other side of the earth or on your local hard disk.</p>

<p>The KDE folder window can not only show you the content of usual
directories. The directory content on an ftp server is displayed in
such a window as well. Perhaps you are used to the WinZip(tm) utility
on MS-Windows(tm), then you will be happy to hear that KDE can look
into tar archives, too. The content of such an archive is displayed in
a folder window as well. You won't notice a difference between them
(well, since the internet is slow, you will notice that ftp
directories will show up much slower than local ones, but that is
not KDEs fault :-)</p>

<p>Clicking for example on an image on some ftp server will start your
favourite image viewer. KDE retrieves the file from the web for you
and starts your image viewer afterwards. For example "oldies" like XV
become internet aware this way! Until there is not yet a KDE
application for your purposes (though there are already KDE
applications for many tasks, and many more a currently written), you
can let old applications make use of NTA simply by providing some
configuration. We'll tell you how to do this later on the
documentation.</p> 

<h3>Icons - drag'n'drop</h3>

<p>We already talked about icons a lot. Right now we had a look at
them if they appeared in folder windows. But icons may as well appear
on the background of the desktop, too. This feature is well known from
most modern desktops like OS/2(tm) and Macintosh(tm). I think you are
not surprised if I tell you that icons on the background of your
desktop behave like the ones in the folder. Clicking on them forces
the same actions to happen, the context sensitive popup menu is the
same and so on. There is only a little difference: You can position
them at will. Icons in a folder window are sorted by name, you can not
save their positions which is why KDE does not allow you user specific
placement of icons in folder windows yet.</p>

<p>You can do many nice things with drag'n'drop. For example, let's
say you have an icon representing an application (this icon may be in
the folder window, on the panel or on the background of your
desktop). When you drop another icon which represents a file on it,
the application starts up and opens the files you dropped on
it. Similarly, you can drop icons over a folder icon. This will copy,
move or link (KDE will ask you what you want) these files in the
folder. Please remember that files can be represented by any URL, not
just local filenames. /home/weis/docu.txt is as valid as
http://www.kde.org.</p>

<p>Many people don't know that they are also allowed to drag icons
which represent applications, printers etc. onto the panel. This
results in a new button on the panel. This button will of course
reappear after logging out and logging in again. In addition to
application and printers, the KDE link files (sometimes referred to as
kdelnk files or "desktop entries") can represent almost everything
from WWW sites, over applications to printers; you have many many
possibilities to explore. If you link an URL on your desktop, KDE
creates such a kdelnk file for you on the fly. The extension "kdelnk"
is hidden, since it does not look very nice. Therefore, kdelnk files
look like usual icons. Prominent kdelnk files are for example the
floppy and cdrom icon that we will discuss now.</p>

<h3>Mounting your devices</h3>

<p>"To mount a device" means that you e.g. add the content of your cdrom
to your directory tree. Unlike MS-Windows, UNIX has one big directory tree
that contains every device. If you click on such a device icon,
KDE will try to mount the device and opens the directory this 
device is mounted on. For example after mounting the cdrom on my system
the directory "/cd" shows up. With a right click on a device button
you get the option to unmount the device again. Unless you unmount it,
you are not allowed to remove the disk or cdrom. To get this automatic
mount feature to work, your /etc/fstab must allow users to mount/unmount
this device. Later chapters will show you what has to be done; you
could also consult the documentation of your OS vendor.</p>

<h2>But I want my command line back!</h2>
<p>Just calm down, there is nothing fear. KDE does not want to take your
beloved (and sometimes very effective) command line away from you. You
can move your files with the desktop, but you can also use the Unix
commands you are accustomed to. KDE provides a very sophisticated
command line window called kvt (more on kvt see elsewhere in this
documentation).</p>

<p>Sometimes, you only want to enter one command on the command
line. In these cases, you do not need a full-blown terminal. Just hit
Alt-F2 and you get a small command line where you can enter one
command. The command line window will disappear afterwards, but it
remembers your command. When you pop up this window (which we call
"minicli" by the way) and hit the "Up" button, you can browse through
all the commands you have entered here before. This feature is known
from normal terminal emulations and shells, too, and is called
"command history".</p>

<h2>Configuring your desktop</h2>
<p>Maybe you do not like the way the desktop looks like. KDE is very
configurable and you can change almost every aspect of the appearance
and the handling of your desktop. You do this with the Control Center,
a special program for configuring your desktop. Launch the Control
Center from the "Go!" menu. On the left half, you can see a list of
so-called modules. Every module allows you to configure a certain
aspect of you desktop. Currently, there are modules for "Desktop",
"Sound System", "Input Devices", "System Information" and
"Network". Others may appear in the future. On the right half, an
introduction screen with some information about your computer is
shown. This is also the area, where the modules show their output. You
open a module by either single-clicking on the "plus" sign next to the
module or double-clicking on the folder icon. Most modules have
several sub-pages.<br>
We will now discuss the varous modules and what you can do with them.</p>

<h3>The module "Desktop"</h3>
<p>In this module, you configure the appearance, like the color, the
icons that KDE puts around your application windows and several
other things. Let's start with changing the background. Double-click
on the colorful "Background" icon, and in the right half of control
center, a form for the background settings appears.</p>

<h4>Configuring the background</h4>
<p>The most prominent part of this form is the large monitor in the
middle where you can see a preview how your entries affect the look of
the desktop. Left and right to it are two buttons with arrows. You
already know that you can distribute your windows over several
desktops. In KDE, you can configure every desktop separately. Simply
choose the desktop you want to configure by clicking on the icons for
browsing forward and backward through the desktops. You can also
change the names of the desktops here by editing the entry field that
shows the name of the currently selected desktop (other ways to change
the names are clicking on the corresponding desktop button on the
panel or choosing Go!->Panel->Configure->Desktops).</p>

<p>There two style options for your background: You can either use a
color (solid or gradient) or a background image (a so-called
wallpaper). Let's start by saying that we want to have a nice solid
pink in our background. Press on the button in the color area. A color
selector appears where you can choose a color (or even mix your own if
you are so inclined). For now, just pick pink (or whatever you like)
and press OK. The color selector disappears and you can see that the
button in the color area you clicked on is now pink. Also, the monitor
above has turned pink since it gives you a preview how your desktop
will look like after applying the changes you have just made. You
could now make these changes permanent by clicking the OK button, but
perhaps you might want to get an impression first how your desktop
will look like. Simply hit the Apply button and the background will
turn pink (or whatever you chose). If you have many open windows on
your desktop, you might not see a bit of the background. Iconify or
close some windows and you can see it again.</p>

<p>If you think that a single color is too boring, what about a
gradient instead? Click on the gradient button, and a second color
button will show up. Here, you can choose the second color which is
the other endpoint of the gradient. Experiment with the two
colors. You can always check the results in the monitor or click on
the Apply button if you want to see your changes "live".</p>

<p>Is this still not enough for you? Well you can always plaster a
wallpaper on your desktop. KDE comes with three stylish wallpapers
(Ocean, Paper and Water), but you can just as easily choose a graphics
file of your own as long as it is in the JPEG format (you can use
kview for graphics format conversion). Either pick one of the
preconfigured wallpapers from the list (your system administrator
might even have provided more wallpapers here), or click on the
"Browse..." button. A file selector box will pop up where you can
choose your file. If the graphics you want to use, is not big enough
to fill the entire desktop, the three buttons to the left of the
"Browse..." button come to the rescue. If you choose "Centered", the
graphics is left as is and simply placed in its original size in the
center of the desktop. "Scaled" means of course scaling the graphics
so that it fills the entire screen. Notice that that could result in
poor quality, depending on the type of the graphics. Finally, "Tiled"
means that the graphics as copied and the copies are just to "tile"
the whole desktop.</p>

<h4>Defining widget colors</h4>
<p>Let's continue with the color configuration which you can find in
the colors submenu of the "Desktop" module in kcc. Unlike in the last
section where we configured the color of the background, we configure
here the colour of the contents and the decorations of windows.</p>

<p>KDE uses a well-known concept called "Color Schemes". These are
sets of colors that look good together. A color scheme in KDE consists
of seven colors: one for the titlebar background when the titlebar is
inactive, one for the titlebar background when the titlebar is
inactive, a color for the titlebar background and text when the
titlebar is active, and two each for the background and the text for
the window background, normal background and selected background. If
this sounds confusing for you we would suggest that you simply try
some of the color schemes. As with the background, you can see in the
top half what the desktop will look like with a certain color
scheme. You can either simply pick one of the preconfigured color
schemes from the list or roll your own. For this, simply choose one of
the ten colors from the option menu "Widget color" and select the
color by clicking on the button below the option menu and choosing a
color in the appearing color selector. See how your changes are
reflected in the preview window. If you have found a combination that
looks especially nice to you, you might want to save it. To do this,
simply click on the "Save" button and choose a filename. If you get
tired of one of your own color schemes you can also remove it with the
"Remove" button, but you can never remove any of the preconfigured
color schemes.</p>

<p>If you have laptop, you might want to increase the contrast of the
colors, but do not want to go through the trouble of handpicking the
colors. The "Contrast" slider helps you out here; move it and see what
happens.</p>

<p>As with the Background dialog, you can also see your color schemes
"live" by clicking on the "Apply" button. See how the windows flicker
a bit and then change their colors online, without you having to
restart the applications before the changes are visible. This has
never been seen before on Unix platforms. There's one caveat, though:
Only KDE applications (i.e. applications especially written for KDE or
other applications turned into a KDE application) can have their
colors configured via the Control Center. We hope that someday all
major applications will have been turned into a KDE application, but
until then you will have to contend yourself with these applications
only having their titlebars changed.</p>

<h4>Choosing a screensaver</h4>
If the same image is shown for too long on a cathode-ray tube, the
image "burns into" the phosphor coating of tube and can be seen as a
shadow image afterwards. In this case, you can effectively consider
your monitor broken (this does not apply to LCD display which generate
their images completely differently). In order to avoid this,
screensavers have been invented. A screensaver is a little program
that lurks in the background and springs into action when you have not
made any inputs to the computer for a certain time (because in most
cases this also means, the same image can be seen for the same
time). Most screensavers display some colorful moving image. Of
course, KDE has screensavers, too. The screensaver dialog of the
"Desktop" module allows you to choose and configure your screensaver
of choice. You can see the now familiar monitor in the top half of the
dialog where a preview of the currently selected screensaver is
shown. You can pick a screensaver from the list of choices (KDE comes
with no less than fifteen screensavers!), and the monitor will show
it. If you want to see the screensaver in full size, you can click on
the "Test" button. Since most screensavers have additional
configuration parameters, always try and click on the "Setup..."
button to see which configuration options a chosen screensaver
has.</p>

<p>In the "Settings" area, you can choose how long the screensaver
should lurk in the background. If choose too long a time, the
screensaver does not protect your screen, and if you choose a time
that is too small, it can be enerving. The default of ten minutes is
probably a good choice.</p>

<p>If you do not want to let others see what is on your screen when
you leave your computer, you can turn on the "Requires password". In
this case, it is not enough to hit a key or move the mouse to turn of
a screensaver, you will also be asked to enter your password. If you
do not want to wait for the screensaver to appear before your work is
concealed from other peoples' eyes, you can also click on the button
with the small padlock on it on the panel.</p>

<p>The entry field "Priority" determines how much time the operating
system should allocate for the screensaver. Unless you have background
tasks running while the screensaver is on, you can probably leave this
on "High".</p>

<h4>Picking a style</h4>
<p>Picking a style means choosing two things: a style for the widgets,
i.e. everything you see on the screen (you can either choose a Windows
95-like style or a Motif-like style) and a font for the
applications. Like the color schemes, these settings only apply to KDE
applications. If you want to preview your choice, you can click on the
"Apply" button, just like in the other dialogs.</p>

<h4>Configuring the titlebar</h4>
<p>As you have already learned, the titlebar provides you not only with
the name of the application and optionally a document name, but also
with up to five buttons with which you can manipulate the windows.</p>

<p>Let's start with the buttons. For each of the five buttons
(Minimize, Maximize, Sticky, Close and Menu), you can choose whether
it should be shown to the left of the titlebar, to the right, or not
at all. We would suggest that you leave all buttons in at the
beginning because they give you quick and easy access to the window
manipulation functions.</p>

<p>On the second page of the titlebar dialog which you reach by
clicking on the "Appearance" tab, you can choose how your titlebar
itself should look like. There are two things to configure: If your
titlebar should be shaded and how fast and if the text in it should be
animated. You can easily find out what the "Shaded" and "Plain"
settings are really for by changing them, clicking on the "Apply"
button and observe the titlebar. The titlebar animation is not so
obvious. The titlebar is only animated when the text in it is too long
to fit into the titlebar. All other desktop and window systems leave
you with an incomplete text here, but KDE makes a difference. The
titlebar animation simply scrolls the text back and forth so that you
have the possibility to read every single bit of it. With the slider,
you can change the speed of this animation (choosing too high a value
will probably make your head feel dizzy after a while), or even turn
the animation off by setting the slider to 0.</p>



<h4>Manipulating window properties</h4>
<p>In the last dialog of the "Desktop" module, you can choose how KDE
should manipulate your windows. If "Window movement" is set to
"transparent", you can see what is below a window while dragging it to
a new location. If it is "opaque", the whole window contents is
moved.</p>

<p>Resize Animation is a unobtrusive animation that is shown when
iconify or deiconify a window. It's just folr the look, and it is up
to you to decide whether to turn it off. On slow machines, turning the
animation off is probably the better idea.</p>

<p>The "Focus Policy" is a very important setting, because it very
much controls how you work with the desktop. Only one window at a time
can "have the focus", and you can only enter text (or ue the keyboard
at all) in the window that has the focus. If you choose
"Focus follows mouse", the window below the mouse pointer gets the
focus. This is also called implicit focus change. If you on the other
hand set the focus policy to "Click to focus", you explicitly have to
click into a window in order to give this window focus. As you may
have guessed, this is also known as explicit focus change.</p>

<p>If you have chosen "Click to focus", the focussed window is always
raised to the top of all windows. But if you have chosen "Focus
follows mouse", it can be the case that an almost completely obscured
window has got the focus (if the is at least a tiny visible piece of
it and the mouse pointe ris over that piece). Since some people
consider this inconvenient, you can turn on auto-raising by choosing a
value with the slider. If a partially obscured window gets the focus
and keeps it for the time chosen with the slider, it is raised
automatically to the top. By choosing a delay of zero seconds, you
turn of auto-raising. Notice that it is probably a bad idea to choose
a very small (non-null) value for the auto-raising delay, since you
will have a lot of window raising on your desktop when moving the
mouse.</p>

<p>The setting "Maximize style" determines what the maximize button
(and the maximize menu item in the window menu) does. You can either
have it maximize the window in both dimensions, or leave the width as
it is and only maximize the height. Notice that the desktop will never
obscure the panel or the taskbar when maximizing &mdash; a very
convenient feature! Notice also that you can always get the other
choice by using the middle mouse button, e.g. if you have chosen
"Maximize vertically", you can still maximize a window fully by
clicking on the maximize button with the middle mouse button.</p>

<h3>The "Sound System" module</h3>
<p>Currently, the Sound System module contains only one dialog where you
can configure the sound of the system bell that normally notifies you
about non-standard conditions like errors. Notice that this will not
work on all systems; please consult your hardware and OS
documentation if you experience any problems.</p>

<h3>The "Input Device" module</h3>
<p>This module allows you to configure your keyboard and your mouse. For
the keyboard, you can configure the repeat rate and an optional key
click (might not work on all machines), for the mouse, you can choose
how fast it should move and whether the left and right buttons should
change meanings (this is convenient if you have the mouse to the left
of your keyboard).</p>

<h3>The "System Information" module</h3>
<p>This module gives you some information about the processor and the
memory you have in your machine. While this may be interesting for
some of you, you do not need to know what is said here; also there is
nothing you could change here.</p>

<h3>The "Sample Group" module</h3>
<p>If you simply try to get your work done, you will probably open this
module. But if you try everything you see on the screen just out of
curiosity, you will probably disappointed about this module: It is
plain empty. It is meant as demonstration, and if you are a programmer
or systems administrator, you can use this module to learn how to
write your own modules for the Control Center.</p>

<h3>The "Network" module</h3>
<p>This module currently only contains one dialog for the Samba Network
Status. Since you need to know quite a lot about Samba to make sense
of the information provided here (and if you do not know what Samba
is, you probably do not need it), we will not discuss this
further.</p>


<h2>Logging out of the KDE</h2>
<p>We sincerely hope that using the KDE gives you so much fun and
pleasure that you never want to log out, but if you do, this is very
easy. Simply hit the small X-like button on the panel, just above the
padlock button. When you log out, KDE saves the positions and sizes of
all application windows that are currently on screen so that it can
open them for you when you log back in. But although KDE can restore
th size and position of every application, it might not be able to
store additional information like open files. For this, it needs
some help from the application. A lot of KDE applications support this
even today, and all of them will when KDE is officially released. In
the meantime, KDE warns you about all the applications which do not
provide enough information to be completely restored.</p>
