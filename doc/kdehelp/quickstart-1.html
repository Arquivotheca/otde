<P>This document is is a brief introduction to the K Desktop Environment.
It will familiarize you with some of the most basic features of KDE</P>

<P>This guide is far from covering all aspects of the K Desktop or even most of
them. It will only describe some of the most basic ways to accomplish a
few of the most common tasks.</P>

<P>We will also assume that you are already familiar with
at least one graphical user interface, as for example CDE(tm), Geos(tm),
GEM(tm), NeXT(tm), MacFinder(tm), Presentation Manager(tm) or
MS-Windows(tm). So we will not explain the usage of a mouse or the
single keys of your keyboard but concentrate on hopefully more interesting 
things.</P>
