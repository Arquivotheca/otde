<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Let there be some windows -- how to launch an application</A></H2>



<P>On the bottom of the screen you find the desktop panel, simply
referred to as panel in the future. Among other purposes the panel is
the first choice if you want to launch an application. Have a look on
the button on the left which shows the two gears. This button is
called the "Go!" button. It has a small arrow on the top to indicate
that it will pop up a menu if you click on it. Just do it! The popup
is called the "Go!" menu and offers you easy-click-access to all
applications which are installed on your computer system. With Mod1-F1
(Mod1 is probably mapped to the Alt-key on a standard PC keyboard
setting) you also have fast keyboard access to this "Go!" menu.</P>


<P>If you use one application or tool very often, then you may want to
have even faster access to it, of course. In this case, you can add a
single application or an entire sub-menu of the "start"-menu as a special
quick-launch button onto the panel. If you want to reach the "Find
Utility" directly via a launch button , simply choose
Go!->Panel->Add Application->Find Utility (By this syntax we mean that
you should first pop up the Go! menu by clicking on the Go! button,
then select "Panel" where the small arrow to the right indicates that
another menu will pop up. In this menu, choose "Add application" and
in the next sub-menu "Find Utility".). Note that you can move all
items of the panel around with the "move" command of the context
menu. Just click with the third mouse button (the third mouse button
is normally the right button, but if you have configured your mouse
for left-handers e.g., it might also be the left one). A menu will pop
up where you can choose "Move". Now move the mouse and see how the icon
follows while still staying on the panel. When you are done, simply
hit the first mouse button (by default the left one). As you have may
have noticed, there is also a menu entry "Remove" in case you are
tired of a certain launch button on your desktop.</P>


<P>This leads us to another interesting topic: KDE usually offers a
context menu on the right mouse button where-ever this is useful. It is
therefore always a good idea to try out the third mouse button on
something, if you do not know what to do with it. Even the background
of the desktops has such a menu!</P>
<P> </P>

<P>There are other interesting things possible with this panel. One
may be important if you have a low-resolution on your monitor, it is
the "hide-and-show"-function: Try to click onto the small button with
the "K"-Label! (By the way, if you are not sure what a certain button
does in KDE, just move the mouse pointer over it and wait for a short
while: KDE has a built-in mini context help, so-called "tooltips",
which explain the functionality of such controls in a few words.</P>


<P>But let us put all these details on hold for a moment and start an
application instead (for example the already mentioned "Find Utility")
and have a look how to manipulate windows in KDE.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 A window! What now?</A></H2>



<P>Well, usually people work <EM>inside</EM> windows, but sometimes you may
want to manipulate windows, for example</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>maximize a window</LI>
<LI>iconify a window (i.e. make it invisible except for a little icon)</LI>
<LI>move a window</LI>
<LI>resize a window</LI>
<LI>switch between windows (meaning you deactivate one and activate
another) </LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Moving and resizing is easy: Just take the window with the mouse at
the titlebar to move it around or drag the window border to resize. As
special gimmick you can also move a window around when you keep the
Mod1-Key down and start the drag  
with the left mouse button *anywhwere* in the entire window. The same
applies for resizing a window if you use the right mouse button.</P>
<P>  </P>

<P>More exiting are the various extra buttons at the top of a window:
KDE windows have some pretty standard buttons on their title-bar which
give you fast access to some common operations. The default button
layout looks like this:</P>
<P> </P>

<P>On the left side:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>a menu button. This usually also shows a pretty mini icon. Click
on it to get a window specific window operations menu. You can also
get this window with Mod1-F3 if you prefer the keyboard.
</LI>
<LI>a sticky button. What the heck is this? Will be explained below
&mdash; stay tuned!</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<P>On the right side:</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>an iconify button. An iconified window is no longer visible on the
screen, but has still an entry on the window-list or the task-bar. It
can easily be restored again.
</LI>
<LI>maximize. Compared to other graphical user interfaces this
maximize button has some neat extra functionality: If you click on it
with the middle mouse button, then the window will only be resized
vertically, with the right mouse button only horizontally.
</LI>
<LI>a button with an "X" on it. This kind of button has a moving
history. Originally defined in the NeXT(tm) system it had the meaning
of "maximize". Unfortunatly Windows 95(tm) redefined the meaning as
"Close". Since virtually every graphical user system since then used
an X-like symbol for the close button (among them the Presentation
Manager (tm), Limbo(tm) and some former attempts for graphical user
interfaces on top of the X Window System), the KDE also uses the
"X"-Button to indicate "Close". The keyboard shortcut for this button
is Mod1-F4. </LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Now that we know how to deal with windows we encourage you to open
some windows with the panel since we will now reveal the secret how to
switch between different windows.</P>


<P>There are several ways to do this. The most simple way is to click
into the new window (Depending on your desktop settings you might have
to click on the title bar or the border to make this work, but you can
also hold Mod1 while clicking into the window; this will activate the
window no matter how your desktop is configured.) An advanced way is
to use the keyboard for that (try Mod1-Tab or Control-Escape for this
purpose). An advanced way for mouse users is to use the task-bar. In
the default KDE setup the task-bar is located in the top left corner,
but it can also be located at the top or the bottom of the screen.</P>


<P>The task-bar is very powerful: A simple click with the left mouse
button on the appropriate task-button will bring you to your
application immediately. The middle mouse button also allows you to
iconify/deiconify a window, And, last but not least, the right mouse
button will pop up a context menu, as usual. This menu is quite
similar to the window operations menu of the window itself and allows
you to do various operations with the window.</P>


<P>If you are coming from a UNIX/X11 background you may perhaps also
enjoy a window-list on kpanel (Go!->Panel->Add Window-list) or on the
background (which is also called the "root window" in the X Window
System) if you click on it with the middle mouse button.</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Now, what was that "sticky" thing?</A></H2>



<P>It may happen that you have more windows open than space on your
desktops. In this case 
you have three possibilities:</P>

<P>
<OL>
<LI> let all windows open (confusing!)</LI>
<LI> Iconify those windows which you do not need at present and use
the taskbar or Mod1-Tab to switch between them (still a bit confusing
and much work!) </LI>
<LI> Recommended: Do what a real operation system does if there is not
enough physical memory: Use virtual memory, in this case virtual
desktops. </LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>Item 3 is the way to go! KDE can handle several different
desktops. You can switch between the virtual desktops very easily with
a click on one of the (default: 4) desktop buttons of kpanel. Also
Control-F1...F8 will send you to the desktop immediately. (There is
also a way similar to the switching of windows, here with Control-Tab).</P>
<P> </P>

<P>Virtual desktops are very nice. But sometimes you want a window to
be present on *every* desktop. This could be for example a small chat
window or a alarm clock or whatever. In this case you can use the
above mentioned "sticky"-button which will pin the window on the
background so that it will occur on every virtual desktop.</P>
<P> </P>

<P>This can also be used to move a window from one virtual desktop to
another one. But it is easier if you use the context popup menu of the
current window (menu item "Onto current desktop") or the "Send to"
sub-menu of the window operations popup of a certain window.</P>
<P> </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 But I want my command line back!</A></H2>


<P>Just calm down, there is nothing fear. KDE does not want to take your
beloved (and sometimes very effective) command line away from you. You
can move your files with the desktop, but you can also use the Unix
commands you are accustomed to. KDE provides a very sophisticated
command line window called kvt (more on kvt see elsewhere in this
documentation).</P>


<P>Sometimes, you only want to enter one command on the command
line. In these cases, you do not need a full-blown terminal. Just hit
Mod1-F2 and you get a small command line where you can enter one
command. The command line window will disappear afterwards, but it
remembers your command. When you pop up this window (which we call
"minicli" by the way) and hit the "Up" button, you can browse through
all the commands you have entered here before. This feature is known
from normal terminal emulations and shells, too, and is called
"command history".</P>
