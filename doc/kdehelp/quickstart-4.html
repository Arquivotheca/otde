<H2><A NAME="s4">4. The power of an integrated desktop</A></H2>


<P>In this section we would like to take you through a couple of
practical exercises which should nicely demonstrate how powerful the 
K Desktop Environment really is.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Using KDE applications</A></H2>


<P>Begin by clicking on the Go! button on the panel and traversing the menu with 
your pointer until you reach 'Applications', then select KEdit. This action should start
an instance of KEdit, a simple text editor provided with the K Desktop Environment. 
Make sure KEdit has focus by single-clicking once on its titlebar. Now create a short
text document by typing any sentence you like, perhaps the one you are
reading right now would be a good choice. Let's save your work by choosing
'Save' from the 'File' menu. Once the file-dialog has come up, make
sure you are in your home-directory and save the test document as 'My Document'
to your home-directory. Close KEdit by choosing 'Exit' from KEdit's 'File' menu.</P>

<P>Having created and saved a little text document, which we named 'My Document',
let us explore a number of different ways of opening this text document.</P>

<P>Open a folder window on your desktop and navigate through it until you
it displays the contents of you home-directory. You should know see
an icon depicting a few pages and a pencil with the name 'My Document'.
The fact that your document was assigned this particular icon indicates
that KDE correctly recognized your document as a text document. Simply
single-click on the icon to open an instance of KEdit displaying the
contents of our test document 'My Document'. Easy, right? </P>

<P>Let us explore another way of opening our test text document.</P>
<P>Open an instance of KEdit by choosing KEdit from the 'Applications' entry
on the Go! menu. Now click on our test document in the still open folder
window and drag the pointer over to KEdit releasing the left mouse
button only over KEdit's white text area. As you can see our test document
is being opened in KEdit. This operation is called 'Drag and Drop'
and is supported by many KDE applications.</P>

<P>Having observed how KEdit behaves if you drag and drop a text document
icon onto it, you will probably not be surprised to find that you can
drag and drop faxes onto KFax and binary documents onto KHexEdit in
order to open them. You might however be surprise to learn that you
can drag and drop documents and folders onto kvt the KDE Desktop
terminal. Try it out and see observe what happens! </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Transparent Internet access</A></H2>


<P>If you are experienced with contemporary desktop environments, much
of the above might not surprise you, in fact you would probably expect a 
powerful contemporary desktop to provide the features mentioned.
KDE however goes one step further than this. It provides transparent
access to the Internet. Let us show you what we mean:</P>

<P>Open a desktop folder and chose 'Open Location' from the 'File' menu.
Type the url: ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde . As you know from the section
introducing the KDE file-manager kfm, this will open an ftp sessions nd
display the contents of the pub/kde directory of ftp.kde.org in the
folder window.</P>

<P>Now let us open in instance of KEdit. Once KEdit is started 'drag 
and drop' the file named 'Message' onto KEdit. Within a few seconds
you should have a copy of it displayed in the text area of KEdit.
How is that for network transparency?</P>

<P>Feel free to explore KEdit's 'Save Url' function to learn how
to save text documents to remote sites.</P>
