<H2>What is KFM ?</H2>
<P>KFM is the file manager for the KDE project. At the
same time it is a full featured web browser, ftp client
and tar archive utility and it acts as a server for
other KDE applications, since it offers its network service
that make up KDEs network transparent file access.</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>You can get an impression about KFMs design goals and
capabilities in this short <a href="kfm_phil.html">article</a>.</p>
<h2>KFM Manual</h2>
<p>You should read this <a href="manual.html">manual</a>.
It is some kind of hitch hikers guide to KFM and a must for every
KDE user unless something different has been written.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<H2>Author</H2>
<P>I am a student of computer sciences at the University of Frankfurt,
Germany. Feel free to contact me and send me your reports, wishes, some
cookies or whatever. I am a poor student and always hungry :-)</P>
<H2>Helpers</H2>
<P>KFM would not be what it is without so many people sending me bug reports,
writing patches and extensions and many good ideas. Thanks to you all.</P>
<p>There are some persons which I want to mention in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:mjones@kde.org><b>Martin Jones</b></a> He wrote
most of the HTML widget and is doing the painful job of bug fixing it
and catching up with Netscapes latest broken HTML features.
<li><a href="mailto:fritz@kde.org><b>Fritz Elfert</b></a> He wrote
the automatic mime type detection stuff at KDE-ONE.
<li><a href="mailto:coolo@kde.org><b>Stephan Kulow</b></a> He did the
automake and autoconf stuff and introduced me to the mysteries
of CVS.
<li><a href="mailto:csorg@stud.uni-frankfurt.de><b>Claudia Sorg</b></a>, my
girlfriend, she had to face my bad moods whenever KFM crashed again
and it crashed very often.
