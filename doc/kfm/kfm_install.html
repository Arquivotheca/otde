<H2>The Source Distribution</H2>
<P>At this time you can get a source distribution of KFM or a precompiled
version. To get the latest version you have to use the source distribution.
This means you have to compile KFM yourself. This is very easy, once you have
the needed parts together. First of all you need the latest release of Qt. At
this time this is 1.2. Of course Qt must be installed and the variable QTDIR
must point to the appropriate directory. You can test this by typing</P>
<PRE>echo $QTDIR</PRE>
<P>on the command line. This should show something like this</P>
<P><CODE>/usr/local/qt-1.2</CODE></P>
<P>In addition to that you must set the KDEDIR variable. Usually is points
to</P>
<P><CODE>/usr/local/kde</CODE></P>
<P>Test it like the one above. It is really important that this is ok.
Otherwise KFM will install in the root directory and you really wont like it.
Since you can read this docu, you may have managed to untar the package in
some directory. From there just type</P>
<P><CODE>./configure</CODE></P>
<P><CODE>make</CODE></P>
<P>and everything should work without problems. You get some error messages ?
Did you install the latest libkde ? Did you install khtmlwidget ? Ahhhh.....
Ok, go and get them from you local KDE site. They have their own installation
instructions. You will need them anyway for KDE. Now you may try again.</P>
<P>To install KFM just type</P>
<P><CODE>make install</CODE></P>
<P>KFM will install some files and directories on startup if they are not
already there. You should have a new directory in your home directory right
now, named <CODE>Desktop</CODE>. This directory will appear on your desktop
after starting KFM. All files in this directory will result in an icon on your
desktop. The kfm configuration stuff is appended to
<CODE>~/.kde/config/.kfmrc</CODE>. Please do not change
<CODE>~/.desktop</CODE>. It is for internal use only.</P>
<P>Now read the section about how to <A href="kfm_config.html">configure
KFM.</A> Now have a happy time :-)</P>
<P>You can already start KFM yet with the command</P>
<P><CODE>kfm</CODE></P>
