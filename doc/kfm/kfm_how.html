<H3>How can I run programs on startup</H3>
<P>KFM can do even more. Throw a program, *.kdelnk file, exectuable, directory
or a link to any of them in the <tt>Autostart</tt> folder on your desktop.
The Autostart filder has the path <tt>$HOME/Desktop/Autostart</tt>. If
KFM finds a kdelnk file, it does what you would epect by double clicking on
the file. Throwing a directory in the autostart folder will open a KFM window
with this directory, executables will of course be executed. But you may
put documents! in the autostart folder, too. In this case KFM will start
the default application for this document with the document as argument.
You can use this to start for example the word processor with your master
thesis whenever you login :-)<BR>You may find it useful to put
<tt>kdisplay -init</tt> and <tt>kpanel</tt> in the autostart folder. The
autostart folder can be used as replacement for <tt>.xinitrc</tt></P>

<A NAME="2">
<H3>How can I start KFM without any opened window</H3>
<P>Many people think that it is annoying that KFM always opens the home
directory. You may start KFM with the option <tt>-d</tt> to avoid this
behaviour.</P>

<A NAME="3">
<H3>How can I open a new view for a directory</H3>
<P>Double clicking with the left mouse button will change the directory,
execute an executable or open a document. One click with the right button
opens a menu and a double click with the middle button on directories will
open a new window for this directory.</P>

<A NAME="4">
<H3>How can I select multiple files</H3>
<P>Press the CTRL key and click once on every file you want to
select. Pressing the right mouse button now will show you all actions that
apply to all files you selected. This way you could start multiple documents
at once or delete/copy/move a couple of files. If multiple files are selected
and you start a drag then all selected files are dragged.</P>

<A NAME="5">
<H3>How can I mount a device</H3>
<P>To mount a device you first need a *.kdelnk file that describes the
device. If you dont have one already, you can read <A HREF="kfm_config.html">here</A>
how to write such files. Once you have done this you may press the right mouse
button over the devices icon. Now you have several mount options. Unmounting
works just like this. Before you can access a device you must mount it first.
Once the device is mounted you can open it with a double click.</P>

<A NAME="6">
<H3>How can I print</H3>
<P>You can throw a document on the printer icon. Now it is up to your printer
daemon/filter. Usually it only makes sense to thore TeX/DVI/PS/ASCII files on
the printer. Be careful. In the worst case your printer may dump out lost of
papers with the ASCII codes of the document you wanted to print. Dont forget
to open the properties dialog of the printer first to check wether the print
command is ok on your system.</P>

<A NAME="7">
<H3>How can I link a URL on the desktop</H3>
<P>You can link any URL with any place on your hard disk. Open the
<tt>Templates</tt> folder or use the menu <tt>File->New</tt> to copy/create a
new URL.kdelnk file or something like this. Open the properties menu and enter
the URL. That's all. If you have a link to this URL in a KFM window or in any
app that supports DND, you may drop the link on every KFM window or on the
desktop. Then click on <tt>Link</tt> and KFM will create a *.kdelnk file for
you on the fly.</P>

<A NAME="8">
<H3>How can I look in a TAR file</H3>
<P>You just have to double click on the <tt>*.tar.gz *.tar *.tgz</tt> file to
have a look at it. You may now delete files or drag files out of the tar
file. Some apps support loading documents out of tar files. You may for
example use KView to open an image that is located in a tar file.</P>
