<h2>What are data types</h2>
<p>A file contains only bits and bytes. One must know how
to interprete them to give them a meaning. A usual method
to archive this is to look at the filename. If it ends
with <tt>.gif</tt> for example, you assume that it is a
GIF image. That's what most desktop environments (further on
called DE) do. KFM does this, too, since it is very fast, but
not convenient. If the extension is not available one does
not know of which data type the file is and that means in turn
that KFM does not know which appliaction can deal with the data.
So if KFM can not figure out the data type by extension it will have
a look in the first bytes of the file and lookup some stuff
in its <i>magic file</i>. This is called
<i>automatic-mime-type-detection-magic</i> and works quite nice.
So if the datatype has an entry in the magic file
<tt>$KDEDIR/share/mimelnk/magic</tt>, then KFM would
know that the file <tt>MyGirlFriend</tt> contains an image.</p>
<p>You must register data types in KFM. This poor little
helper of yours must know common extensions of this data type,
an icon, some descriptive text, perhaps a default application
( we will learn more about this later ) and the mime type.</p>
<h2>What is a Mime Type</h2>
<p>Mime types are an internet standard. This standard is a naming
scheme for data types. A data types name is devided in two sections.
The first one tells about the general kind of data ( image, video,
audio, text ... ) and since there are different kinds of text
( C-sources, english text, ... ) and different formats for saving
images and so on, the second part tells abou the special format.
A good example is <tt>image/gif</tt>. The first part tell,
its an image and the second one tells, it is saved in GIF format.</p>
<p>If you are not shure about the correct mime type, then have a look
at the magic file, many many mime types are already registered there.</p>
<p>Usually this chapter is only of interest for system maintainers and
application developers. A proper installed KDE should come with all
this stuff already done, but some people always want to know how stuff
works, so here we go.
<p>The directory <tt>$KDEDIR/share/mimelnk</tt> contains many subdirectories
which correspond to the first section of the mime type names. For example
our example <tt>image/gif</tt> is represented by a file named
<tt>$KDEDIR/share/mimelnk/image/gif.kdelnk</tt>. Every KFM config file
has the <tt>.kdelnk</tt> extension. Sometimes KFM hides this extension, since
it does not look very nice. Hackers may now have a look at this file, it is
very simple and of course human readable. But you can have a look at it
here:</p>
<pre>
# KDE Config File
[KDE Desktop Entry]
Type=MimeType
MimeType=image/gif
Icon=image.xpm
Patterns=*.gif;*.GIF;
Comment=Gif images
Comment[de]=GIF Dokument
Comment[nl]=Gif afbeelding
</pre>
<p>You dont need to understand what this means, since KFM provides a GUI
for you, that makes things much easier. Hackers may continue reading here,
all the others can skip this and continue in the <a href="mime2.html">next
chapter</a>.</p>
<p>The first line is the header of every KDE config file.
The <tt>Type</tt>line is included in every KFM config file to
distinguish the purpose of the config file. This is followed
by the mime types name, the icon, a <tt>;</tt> separated list
of patterns and comments in english, german, ...</p>
<p>Now the hackers may leave this lesson.</p>
