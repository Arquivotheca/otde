<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Setting up <EM>kppp</EM></A></H2>


<P> <CODE> PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO READ THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ! THANK YOU!</CODE></P>
<P>In order to set up <EM>kppp</EM>, start <EM>kppp</EM> and push the <CODE>Setup</CODE> button on <EM>kppp</EM>'s
main window. A new tab dialog will appear. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Accounts</A></H2>

<P>This dialog will display the accounts you have created. You must create at least
one account.  The ``Reset Button'' will
reset the accumulated cost for the selected account to zero. Typically you 
want to press this button once a month after having consolidated your 
telephone costs. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Device</A></H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Modem Device</B><DD><P>Select the device appropriate for your hardware.</P>

<DT><B>Flow Control</B><DD><P>Select from Hardware (CRTSCTS), Software (XON/XOFF) and
no flow control. The recommended setting is Hardware flow control.</P>

<DT><B>Line Termination</B><DD><P>Choose the correct ``Enter'' character sequence for your modem.
Most modems will use ``CR/LF''. However some modems need a different setting.
If you experience trouble while running a script: Play with this parameter.</P>

<DT><B>Connection Speed</B><DD><P>Choose from the list of connections speeds supported by
your serial port.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="lock files"></A> 
 </P>
<DT><B>Lock File Directory</B><DD><P>Enter the path-name of the desired modem lock file.
Under Linux this is typically /var/lock and you shouldn't change this
to anything else unless you know what you are doing. Programs such
as mgetty depend on the existence of such lock files and <EM>kppp</EM> will
not work with mgetty if the lock file is not set correctly.
If you leave this edit-box empty, <EM>kppp</EM> will not attempt to create a 
lockfile. Make sure that you don't use the option "lock" to pppd
if you entered a modem lock file and thus want <EM>kppp</EM> to lock the modem,
since the pppd option "lock" will induce pppd to try to lock the
modemdevice. However since <EM>kppp</EM> already locked the device pppd
will fail and <EM>kppp</EM> will display "pppd died unexpectedly".
Make sure that you have permission to write to the lock file
directory or <EM>kppp</EM> will display the error message:"Can't create lock file".</P>

<DT><B>Modem Timeout</B><DD><P>This is the time in seconds that <EM>kppp</EM> waits for the 
``CONNECT'' response from your modem after dialing into another modem. (Typically a modem
of your IPS's modem pool ) I recommend a setting of about 30 seconds.</P>
</DL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Modem</A></H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Modem Commands</B><DD><P>This will bring up a dialog which you will need
to fill with modem commands appropriate for you particular modem. If you
own a Hayes compatible modem you most likely won't need to change any of
the defaults. I encourage you however to read  about the Hayes command
in the Appendix of this documentation. The information supplied there 
should also be of help in case  you experience trouble setting up a stable 
connection with your ISP's modems.</P>

<DT><B>Query Modem</B><DD><P>Pushing the Query Modem Button will induce <EM>kppp</EM> to ask
your modem to identify itself. On success your modems response will be
displayed in a dialog. This may or may not prove to be informative depending
on your modem.</P>

<DT><B>Terminal</B><DD><P>Pushing the <CODE>Terminal</CODE> button will bring up a mini terminal.
You can use the mini terminal to test your modem and experiment with  the 
negotiation protocol for initiating a ppp connection with you ISP. You no 
longer need a terminal program such as minicom or seyon.</P>
</DL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 PPP</A></H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>pppd Timeout</B><DD><P><EM>kppp</EM> will wait this amount of time after running the script
and starting pppd for pppd to establish a valid ppp link before giving up
and killing pppd.</P>

<DT><B>Automatic Redial on Disconnect</B><DD><P>Selecting this will have <EM>kppp</EM> try to 
reconnect in case you inadvertently got disconnected while online.</P>

<DT><B>Show Clock on Caption</B><DD><P>This will have <EM>kppp</EM> display the time connected
on the caption of the <EM>kppp</EM> window displayed while being online.</P>

<DT><B>Disconnect on X-server shutdown</B><DD><P>Checking this option will cause <EM>kppp</EM>
to terminate the ppp link, disconnect the modem and terminate accounting
in an orderly fashion when the X-server shuts down. This is useful if
you are prone to forget to shut down <EM>kppp</EM> on X-server exit or simply
don't want to have to worry about disconnecting your connection.
If you don't want <EM>kppp</EM> to hang up the modem on X-server exit, you should
leave this checkbox unchecked. Be aware however, that if you have accounting
enabled, and you don't want <EM>kppp</EM> to hang up on X-server exit,  you will 
have a nonterminated accounting entry in you accounting logs, when the
X-server exits and <EM>kppp</EM> terminates.</P>

<DT><B>Minimize Window on Connect</B><DD><P><EM>kppp</EM>'s window will be minimized after a connection has been established. The elapsed connection time will be shown in the taskbar.</P>

<DT><B>Dock into Panel on Connect</B><DD><P>If this option is chosen <EM>kppp</EM> will dock into the panel where it will be symbolized by a small animated icon. Use the left mouse button on this icon to restore <EM>kppp</EM>'s window. The right mouse button will open up a popup-menu</P>
<P>that offers to restore the window, show further transfer statistics or close the connection.
This option overrides <EM>Minimize Window on Connect</EM>.</P>
