</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="kppp FAQ"></A> <H4>I can't get kppp to work. kppp tells me that pppd has died or that a timeout has expired! </H4>

<P>Did you read the this manual carefully? Here are once more the most common
pitfalls.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Make sure that pppd is the actual pppd binary not a script
</LI>
<LI> Make sure that your /etc/ppp/options file exists, but is empty!
</LI>
<LI> Make sure that you DON'T use the options "lock" as an argument
for pppd (kppp is already taking care of device locking )</LI>
<LI> RedHat users: remove the "lock" option from your /etc/ppp/options 
file!
</LI>
<LI> Make sure you set the right permission. In case of trouble
you might want to run it as root first and then later, when
everything is working o.k give it less harmful permission if you can not
afford to run kppp setuid root. The proper way to proceed would probably
be creating a "modem" group.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>kppp tells me ``Sorry, can't open the modem''.</H4>

<P>
<P>This means that kppp doesn't have permissions to open the modem
device or that you selected a modem device on the Modem Tab Dialog that is
not valid. First make sure you selected the right modem device. Once you are
sure you have selected the right modem device, you must 
give kppp the right permission to access the modem 
device and to be able to modify /etc/resolv.conf in case you want kppp to 
configure DNS correctly for you. If you can afford to run kppp setuid root
this would solve all access problems for you, if not you will have to figure
out what the right permissions are for your purposes. In order to give
kppp setuid root permissions do the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% su root
% chown root:root $(KDEDIR)/bin/kppp
% chmod +s $(KDEDIR)/bin/kppp
% exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<H4>kppp tells me it can't create a modem lock file.</H4>

<P>This in most instances means that you have installed kppp
without SETUID bit on while you, the person executing kppp, 
doesn't have write access to the lock file directory which
by default is /var/lock. This for example is the case on 
RedHat systems. Check the modem dialog for the
precise location you have chosen. The solution is easy --
either run kppp SETUID if you can afford to, or give regular
users write access to /var/lock or create a modem group
that will have access to the /var/lock file.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Why is Kppp installed with the SETUID bit on?</H4>

<P>
<P>There is no need for the SETUID bit, if you know a bit of Unix systems 
administration. Simply create a modem group, add all users that you
want to give access to the modem to that group and make the modem
device read/writeable for that group. Also if you want DNS configuration
to work with Kppp, then /etc/resolv.conf must be read/writeable by the
members of that group. 
<P>Please do not criticize me for installing Kppp with setuid bit
on, I simply can no longer handle the amount of mail I used to get from
desperate users who had problems getting kppp to work because they 
didn't understand enough about Unix and device permissions.
<P>
<P>
<H4>kppp just sits there and waits: Expecting OK</H4>

<P>Have you played with the CR/LF setting?
<P>
<P> Your modem might not sustain
a fast initialisation. Turn off the 'Modem sustains fast initialisation'
button on the Modem tab dialog.
<P>
<P>
<H4>How do I make kppp send a \n or a \r?</H4>

<P>Just send an empty string such as in the following script:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Send                                   # send an empty string
Expect      ID:                        
Send        itsme                     
Expect      word:                      
Send        forgot                    
Expect      granted                    
Send        ppp                        
                                       
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>kppp complains: "Can't create lock file"</H4>

<P>
<P>This means that you don't have permissions to create a lock file.
If for example you have specified '/var/lock/LCK..modem" on the
modem dialog tab, you must have write permission to write
to /var/lock/. This is of course no problem if you have
given kppp setuid permissions. Please read the section on 
<A HREF="kppp-3.html#lock files">lock files</A>
.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Can I do PAP and CHAP with kppp?</H4>

<P>Yes you can. Please the see the section on using 
<A HREF="kppp-7.html#PAP">PAP and CHAP</A> 
with kppp in the appendix. Actually, I receive more an more requests for
detailed information about how to use PAP nor CHAP with kppp. 
If you are using PAP and CHAP with kppp, I would very much appreciate 
submissions of
detailed step by step explanations of how to do PAP and/or CHAP with kppp.
I would then include this here in the kppp documentation. I am sure
this would be of help to a great number of beginners. Please consider
helping out and giving something back in return for kppp. Thanks!
<P>
<P>
<H4>How do I write a telephone cost rules file?</H4>

<P>Just follow the TEMPLATE rules files supplied with kppp. You should be
able to find a copy in the <CODE>$(KDEDIR)/doc/HTML/kppp</CODE>. 
Use the -r kppp command line options to check the syntax of your proposed
rules file.
<P>
<P>
<H4>I have written a telephone cost rules file for my region. Where can I submit it so that others can make use of it?</H4>

<P>I would love to receive any rule files written. I will make them available
on my kppp 
<A HREF="http://math.cornell.edu/~wuebben/kppp/kppp.html">web page</A>.
Before you send me a new rules file make sure it is not already available on 
the kppp web page. Then email the new rules file  to 
<A HREF="mailto:wuebben@math.cornell.edu">me</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H4>My country observes a moving holiday different from easter.</H4>

<P>In that case you need to write new code that allows for the computation of that
holiday. Please have a look at ruleset.cpp and emulate the ``easter'' example.
Then send 
<A HREF="mailto:wuebben@math.cornell.edu">me</A> the patches.
