<CODE>ktalkd </CODE>is an enhanced talk daemon - the program that handles incoming talk requests,
announces them and lets you respond to it with a talk client.<br>
GLOSSARY : In those pages, if somebody wants to talk to you, you are designated as the "callee".<br>
<CODE>ktalkd </CODE>has the following features :

<UL>
<LI><B>KDE or not KDE</B>: That is the question. :) More seriously, this means that
<CODE>ktalkd </CODE>is able to be compiled with or without KDE support.
To use without KDE, the compilation stage will detect if X or Qt or KDE is not installed,
but you can force a non-KDE daemon if you use the configure option '--without-X'.<BR>
<LI><B>Answering machine</B>: If the callee isn't loggued, or doesn't answer after
the second announcement, an answering machine is launched, takes the
message, and mails it to the callee.<BR>
<LI><B>Sound</B>: If desired, a sound is played with the announcement.<BR>
<LI><B>X Announce</B>: If compiled with KDE installed, ktalkd will try to contact
<CODE>ktalkdlg</CODE> to make a KDE dialog for announcement.<BR>
<LI><B>Multiple displays annoucement</B>: If you are logged remotely (e.g. with an
<CODE>export DISPLAY=... &lt;command&gt;</CODE>), the X announcement will be made on
this display too. Answer on the one you want ! <I>New in 0.5.6 !</I><BR>
<LI><B>Configuration</B>: If KDE-compiled, it reads config from KDE config files,
the sitewide ($KDEDIR/share/config/ktalkdrc) and the user one, in its home directory.
The sitewide one has to be manually edited by the administrator, but there is now
a configuration dialog for the user one. It's called <CODE>kcmktalkd</CODE> and can 
be found in the KDE Control Center after installing <CODE>ktalkd</CODE>.
On non-KDE systems, <CODE>ktalkd</CODE> will read /etc/talkd.conf.<BR>
<LI><B>Internationalization</B>: Under KDE, the announcement will be in your language provided that
you set it in the KDE menus and that someone translated <CODE>ktalkdlg</CODE> to your language.<BR>
Internationalization still has to be done for the configuration dialog...
