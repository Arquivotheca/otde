<H3><A NAME="s4">4. Usage</A></H3>
<P>Not much to say about ktalkd : it is a daemon. No user interface for it.<BR>
The announcement dialog box is trivial : respond or ignore.</P>
<P>The configuration dialog should be rather straight forward, except for setting up a
forward to another user (or even to another host).</P>
<H4>Choosing a forward method</H4>
<P>None is perfect, they all have pros (+) and cons (-).</P>

<P><B>FWA</B> : Forward announcement only. Direct connection. Not recommended.<BR>
       (+) You know who is the caller, but<BR>
       (-) Caller will have to respond to an announcement from you. Annoying.<BR>
       (-) Don't use if you have an answering machine on your 'away' location<BR>
 (The answering machine can't popup an announcement, it would be confusing!)
</P>
<P><B>FWR</B> : Forward all requests, changing info when necessary. Direct connection.<BR>
       (+) Caller won't know that you're away, but<BR>
       (-) You won't really know who's the caller - only his username,<BR>
           (so you might see "talk from Wintalk@my_host")
</P>
<P><B>FWT</B> : Forward all requests and take the talk. No direct connection.<BR>
       (+) Same as above, but works also if you and caller can't be in direct 
           contact one with the other (e.g. firewall).<BR>
       (+) You'll be told who's really talking to you when you accept the talk<BR>
       (-) But as in FWR, you won't know his machine name in the announcement
</P>
<P>In short, use <B>FWT</B> it you want to use it behind a firewall (and if ktalkd
can access both networks), and <B>FWR</B> otherwise.</P>
