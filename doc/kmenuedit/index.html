<H1>KMenuedit - Menu editor for KPanel</H1>

<P>KMenuedit enables the user to change the menu that is presented by KPanel
whenever the user presses the button with the great 'K'. This menu consists
indeed of two menus:&nbsp;the system default menu, create by KDE itself,
and a personal menu that any user can change to his/ her needs.</P>

<P>KMenuedit tries to make the modification of these menus as easy as possible.</P>

<H2><A NAME="start"></A>Concept</H2>

<P>Most systems use binary or ascii encoded configuration files to define
a menu structure. KDE takes a different approach. KDE uses a directory
hierarchy of kdelnk-files. Each submenu corresponds to a directory and
each menuentry corresponds to a kdelnk-file. (kdelnk-files are special
ascii files which names' end in '.kdelnk'.)</P>

<P>One way to edit the menu is to move or copy the kdelnk-files to change
the menu hierarchy and to change each menuentry with the properties dialog
of KFM.</P>

<P>The other way is to use KMenuedit.</P>

<H2><A NAME="usage"></A>Usage</H2>

<P>KMenuedit tries to hide the details of kdelnk-files from the user, so
you don't need to worry if you don't understand the concept behind the
kdelnk-files.</P>

<P>When you start KMenuedit for the first time it will probably ask you
for the basedirectories of your menus. If you don't know what this means
it should be save to say ok to the dialog.</P>

<P>After KMenuedit has started it will show you two menus.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="kmenuedit1.gif" HEIGHT=452 WIDTH=526></P>

<P>The left menu is your personal menu and the right menu is the system
default menu. Normaly you won't have a personal menu yet, so you will see
a menu with just one entry called 'EMPTY'.</P>

<P>The entries in the right menu are displayed with a gray color because
you don't have write permission to the system default menu. If you start
KMenuedit with sufficient privileges then this menu will be displayed normal
and you may change it.</P>

<P>If you don't like the position of these menus in the window, hold down
the shift key and the middle mouse button and move the menu arround. The
position of the base menus will be saved for the next time you start KMenuedit.</P>

<P>There are several ways to <I>add</I> an entry to a menu:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Drag a kdelnk-file or any executable with kfm and drop it on a menu.</LI>

<LI>Press the right mouse button on a menuentry and select 'New' from the
popupmenu.</LI>

<LI>Drag a menuentry from another menu and drop it on the menu.</LI>
</UL>

<P>To <I>delete</I> a menuentry press the right mouse button on this entry
and select 'Delete' from it's popupmenu.</P>

<P>To <I>open a submenu</I>, select 'Open/ Close' from the popupmenu or
click with the left mouse button on the menuentry. Do just the same to
<I>close the submenu</I>. Note that closing a submenu closes all of it's
submenus, too.</P>

<P>You may even use<I> cut, copy and paste</I> with menuentries by selecting
the correspondig option in the popupmenu. Just select 'copy' on one menuentry
and select 'paste' on another entry to insert the copied menuentry below
this entry.</P>

<P>To <I>move</I> an entry to another position within it's menu, hold down
the middle mouse button on this entry and move it around.</P>

<P>To insert an new <I>seperator </I>or <I>submenu</I> select 'New'&nbsp;from
the popupmenu and <A HREF="#change">change</A> the new entry.</P>

<P>If you exit KMenuedit before saving no changes will be written to disk
and if you want to discard all changes without restarting KMenuedit, just
press the reload button.</P>

<H4><A NAME="change"></A>Changing menu entries</H4>

<P>To change a menuentry select 'Change' from its popupmenu. You will be
presented the following dialog.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="kmenuedit2.gif" HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=376></P>

<P>The combobox in the first line selects the type of the menu entry. To
see a description of the various types see <A HREF="#file-types">Entry
Types</A>.</P>

<P>The next lines specify various attributes that are common to most menuentries.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>FileName: </B>The filename of the kdelnk-file.</LI>

<LI><B>Name:</B> The name of the menuentry.</LI>

<LI><B>Icon:</B> The big icon shown by kfm.</LI>

<LI><B>MiniIcon: </B>The small icon shown by kpanel.</LI>

<LI><B>Comment:</B> The descriptive text displayed by kpanel and kfm.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Due to the fact that any menuentry is saved into a seperate kdelnk-file
each file needs a unique name inside its submenu. If you don't specify
a filename, KMenuedit will create its own filename.</P>

<P>If you want to change the icons, just click on the icon and select the
new icon from a dialog.</P>

<P>The attributes within the tab-dialog are type specific and are described
in <A HREF="#file-types">Entry Types</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="file-types"></A>Entry Types</H2>

<P>KDE&nbsp;knows about several types of kdelnk-files and so we have different
types of menu-entries.</P>

<P><B>Submenu:<BR>
</B>The submenu is not a kdelnk-file but a directory. So the only attributes
that make sense for a submenu are Name, Icon, MiniIcon and Comment.</P>

<P><B>Separator:<BR>
</B>Like the submenu the separator is not a real kdelnk-file but this fact
makes no difference for the user. Since a separator is just a bar there
are no attributes you may set.</P>

<P><B>Application:<BR>
</B>The application type is a real kdelnk-file. Please see the <A HREF="../kfm/kfm_apps.html">kfm</A>
manual for a detailed description of its attributes.</P>

<P><B>Link:<BR>
</B>The link is basically a link to an object in the WWW. Just insert it's
url in the corresponding field.</P>

<P><B>Device:<BR>
</B>The device is a kdelnk-file, too. Please see the <A HREF="../kfm/kfm_config.html">kfm</A>
manual for details.</P>

<P><B>Swallow:<BR>
</B>The swallow type is like an application entry but it is executed in
a different way. You execute it by dropping it onto KPanel to make it a
panel button. KPanel will start the application and swallow its window
into the panel. To find the right window to swallow KPanel needs the title
of the application window. So you have to specify the application you want
to swallow and its title.<BR>
As an option you may specify an application to start when you press with
the left mousebutton onto the panel button.</P>

<H2><A NAME="todo"></A>To do</H2>

<P>I&nbsp;don't know. Suggestions are welcome.</P>
