<p>

Disk Navigator is a simple utility to navigate through the filesystem starting
from the KPanel menu. It is activated when the "Disk Navigator" entry from
the KPanel menu is selected. In this case, a root menu with the following 
entries is shown:


<list>
<item><bf>Global:</bf> 
  this section lists global entries, shared among all users.
  Tipical global entries include: / (root dir), CD-ROM, mounted filesystems,
  removable disks, etc.
  Global entries can be changed selecting the "Options" menu entry.
  Note: only the superuser can change global entries. 

<item><bf>Local:</bf> this section lists user-specific filesystem entries. 
  Tipical entries in this section are user's home dir, user's desktop, 
  frequently accessed directories. Local entries can be changed selecting 
  the "Options" menu entry.

<item><bf>Recent:</bf>
  this section lists recently accessed documents, applications
  and folders.  When a document or application is accessed, it goes in the
  "Recent" section along with its parent folder. The number of folders and
  files that are kept in this section can be set selecting the "Options" menu
  entry.

<item><bf>Options:</bf>
  shows a configuration dialog that can be used to specify some settings.
  For a description of available settings, see the "Options" Section.

</list>

The root menu is highly customizablem, as explained in the remaining sections.

<p>

<list>

<item>
Disk Navigator can be used to quickly access files in any mounted filesystem,
including local files, remote files (eg. NFS mounts), removable media
(CD-ROM, Iomega Zip, floppy drive), etc.
When a file is selected, the action performed is exactly the same performed
when the file is selected in a KFM window.

<item>
On the top of each menu (except the first one) there is an entry "Open Folder".
when this entry is selected, a KFM window is launched using the current
folder as URL. If you hold the Shift key when selecting this entry, Disk
Navigator opens a terminal in the current folder.

<item>
Slow devices: accessing a folder on a slow device can stop Disk Navigator
for a while (eg. entering a folder with a large number of files on a slow
CD-ROM reader). Since you may want to place entry points to slow devices on
the root menu, you might accidentally enter such slow entries.
To avoid this problem, you can add a "Removable Media" folder to the 
global/local sections, and place links to slow devices in this folder.
See the "Options" section to see how to customize the global/local sections.

<sect>Options
<!--################################################################## -->
<p>

The option dialog box is activated selecting "Disk Navigator" -> "Options" from
the KPanel menu. It is possible to set the following options:

  <list>

  <item><bf>"Edit Local..."</bf>, <bf>"Edit Global..."</bf>
  these buttons allow to change entries in the Local and Global Sections
  (note: only superusers can change global settings).
  In both cases, a kfm window is displayed. Use normal dragging operations to
  create symbolic links and folders in the local (~/.kde/share/disknav) and
  global ($KDEDIR/share/disknav) directories. When either the "Apply" or the
  "OK" button in the Options dialog is selected, these directories are parsed
  again and the "Disk Navigator" menu is updated.
  Alternatively, it is possible to change local and global directory contents
  from the command line (e.g. using a shell script). In such case, the panel
  must be restarted ("Panel" -> "Restart" from the KPanel menu) to re-parse
  these directories.

  <item><bf>"Max recent folder entries":</bf>
  how many folders are stored in the "Recent" section.

  <item><bf>"Max recent file entries":</bf>
  how many files (applications or documents) are
  stored in the "Recent" section.

  <item><bf>"Max files in a single folder":</bf>
  if the number of files in a folder exceeds 
  this limit, the folder content is not displayed (and a "Too Many Files"
  icon is displayed). It is suggested that this limit is kept not too high
  for slow systems. Future version of Disk Navigator will probably get rid
  of this problem (see the "Limitations" section).

  <item><bf>"Show dot files"</bf>
   sets if hidden files should be displayed in "Disk Navigator" menus.

  <item><bf>"Ignore case when sorting":</bf>
  if set, uses the order "A", "a", "B", "b" when
  sorting rather than "A", "B", "a", "b".

  <item><bf>"Show Global section":</bf>
  if set, the Global section is shown.

  <item><bf>"Show Local section":</bf>
  if set, the Local section is shown.

  <item><bf>"Show Recent section":</bf>
  if set, the Recent section is shown.
  Note that when this option is turned off,
  the list of recently accessed folder/files is not updated (some
  users might turn this option off for `privacy' reasons).

  <item><bf>"Show Option entry":</bf>
  if set, the Option entry is shown. Note that the Option dialog box can be
		accessed from the KPanel configuration dialog. The "Option" entry 
		here is just a shortcut for those who change frequently Disk
		Navigator options.

  <item><bf>"Terminal application":</bf>
  Application that must be run when "Open Folder" is selected holding the
  Shift key.

</list>

<sect>Notes
<!--################################################################## -->
<p>

<list>

<item>
Disk Navigator menus are updated automatically when directory
contents change, except the first menu, that is updated through the
Options dialog.

<item>
The contents of the "Recent" section are saved in the
~/.kde/share/config/kpanelrc configuration file. If you want to clear this
section, you can clear the <tt>RecentFolders</tt> and <tt>RecentFiles</tt>
entries in this file after logging out from KDE.

<item>
Documents and applications not accessed through the KPanel are not added 
to the "Recent" section. This limitation is going to disappear in future
versions of Disk Navigator.

<item>
Due to efficiency reasons, most files are not displayed with the same icon
you would see in a file manager window. With the current version, only
<tt>.kdelnk</tt> files have the corresponding icon displayed. Other files
are displayed with two different icons to distinguish between data files
and executables.

</list>

<!--################################################################## -->
<sect>Configuration File (<em>advanced topic</em>)
<!--################################################################## -->
<p>

Configuration information for Disk Navigator are stored in the
<tt>~/.kde/share/config/kpanelrc</tt> configuration file. The group
is <tt>[kdisknav]</tt>.

Usually you don't need to edit this file manually, as this can be done through
the Options dialog box. This section documents entries related to 
Disk Navigator. If the option is missing in the configuration file, its
default value is assumed. Note that a broken [kdisknav] group can be repaired
simply removing all the entries listed here (their default value will be
assumed).

<list>

<item>
<bf>MaxNavigableFolderEntries</bf>=<em>n</em> : if a folder contains more than <em>n</em> entries, 
a "Too many files" message is displayed.

Default: 200

<item>
<bf>MaxRecentFoldersEntries</bf>=<em>n</em> : the "Recent" menu section will contain the last
<em>n</em> folders open through Disk Navigator.

Default: 4

<item>
<bf>MaxRecentFilesEntries</bf>=<em>n</em> : the "Recent" menu section will contain the last
<em>n</em> files open through Disk Navigator.

Default: 4

<item>
<bf>ShowDotFiles</bf>=on/off : should dot (hidden) files be showed in the Disk Navigator?

<item>
<bf>RecentFiles</bf>=<em>path1,path2,path3...</em> : list of recently opened files.

<item>
<bf>RecentFolders</bf>=<em>path1,path2,path3...</em>: list of recently opened folders.

<item>
<bf>IgnoreCase</bf>=on/off : should Disk Navigator sort files in case-sensitive mode?

        Navigator main menu?

Default: on

<item>
<bf>ShowLocalSection</bf>=on/off : should the Local section be part of the Disk 
        Navigator main menu?

Default: on

<item>
<bf>ShowRecentSection</bf>=on/off : should the Recent section be part of the Disk
