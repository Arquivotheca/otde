<P>KFontManager is a font manager for the KDE project. KFontManger was designed
to work in conjunction with kfontdialog version 0.5 and higher.</P>
<P>The neccessity for a Font-Manager arose from the following facts:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The font-list in kfontdialog used to be hard-coded. This was clearly
not desirable. </LI>
<LI>Not all fonts that come with the X11 window system are useful. Were
kfontdialog simply to display all fonts availabe on your X server system,
you would over and over again be confronted with the same list of fonts,
some of which completely unusable. KFontManger allows you to select which
fonts you want to be available to KDE applications and in particular to
kfontdialog.</LI>
