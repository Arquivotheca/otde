The <I>KDE network utilities</i> program allows you to make a ping, 
a traceroute or an host resolution without lauching a terminal emulator.  
<p>

You choose which utility you want to run by selecting the
corresponding tab. You give the parameters needed for it and then
click on the "<tt>Go!</tt>" button (or hit <i>return</i>). While the
command is running, you can stop it by pushing the "<tt>Stop</tt>" button.

<H4>What is it?</H4> 

The <tt><A HREF=man:ping>ping(8)</a></tt> command send ICMP
<TT>ECHO_REQUEST</tt> packets to network hosts to check for network
reachability. A response from a host (or anything that have an IP
address) says that this host is running at least a TCP/IP network
stack and indicates that the network route to go to this host is
opened. The <i>ping</i> tab allows the execution of the
<tt>ping(8)</tt> command.

<H4>Description</H4>

Ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory <tt>ECHO_REQUEST</tt> datagram
to elicit an ICMP <tt>ECHO_RESPONSE</tt> from a host or gateway.
<tt>ECHO_REQUEST</tt> datagrams (``<i>pings</i>'') have an IP and ICMP header,
followed by a <tt>struct timeval</tt> and then an arbitrary number of
<i>pad</i> bytes used to fill out the packet. 

<p>
<u><b>Options:</b></u>
<ul>

<li><B>Make host name resolution</B><br>

Print addresses numerically rather than symbolically and
numerically (this saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup).
</ul>

<p>

When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the
local host, to verify that the local network interface is up and
running.  Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be
``<i>pinged</i>''. Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are
computed.  If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in
the packet loss calculation, although the round trip time of these
packets is used in calculating the minimum/average/maximum
round-trip time numbers.  When the program is terminated, a brief
summary is displayed.

<B>This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
management.  Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is
unwise to use ping during normal operations or for too long.</B>

<A name=traceroute>
<H2>The <i>traceroute</i> tab</H2></A>

<IMG SRC=knu-traceroute.gif ALT="A screen shot of the traceroute tab">

<H4>What is it?</H4> 

The <tt><A HREF=man:traceroute>traceroute(8)</a></tt> command print
the route that packets take to network host. The <i>traceroute</i> tab
allows the execution of the <tt>traceroute(8)</tt> command.

<H4>Description</H4> 

The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware,
connected together by gateways.  Tracking the route one's packets
follow (or finding the miscreant gateway that's discarding your
packets) can be difficult.  Traceroute utilizes the IP protocol
<i>time to live</i> field and attempts to elicit an ICMP
<tt>TIME_EXCEEDED</tt> response from each gateway along the path to
some host.

<p>
<u><b>Options:</b></u>
<ul>

<li><B>Make host name resolution</B><br>

Print hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and
numerically (this saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup for each
gateway found on the path).

<li><B>Max number of hops</B><br>

Set the max time-to-live (maximum number of hops) used in outgoing
probe packets.  The default is 30 hops (the same default used for
TCP connections).

</ul>

<P>

This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow to
some internet host by launching UDP probe packets with a small ttl
(time to live) then listening for an ICMP "<tt>time exceeded</tt>"
reply from a gateway.  We start our probes with a ttl of one and
increase by one until we get an ICMP "<tt>port unreachable</tt>"
(which means we got to "<i>host</i>") or hit a max (which defaults to
30 hops and can be changed with the <B>Max number of hops</B> option).
Three probes are sent at each ttl setting and a line is printed
showing the ttl, address of the gateway and round trip time of each
probe.  If the probe answers come from different gateways, the address
of each responding system will be printed.  If there is no response
within a 3 sec. timeout interval, a "*" is printed for that probe.

<P>
We don't want the destination host to process the UDP probe packets so
the destination port is set to an unlikely value.
<P>

<B>
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
management.  It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
Because of the load it could impose on the network, it is unwise to
use traceroute during normal operations or for too long.</B>

Implemented by Van Jacobson from a suggestion by Steve Deering.  Debugged
by a cast of thousands with particularly cogent suggestions or fixes from
C. Philip Wood, Tim Seaver and Ken Adelman.

<H2>The <i>host resolution</i> tab</H2></A>

<IMG SRC=knu-host.gif ALT="A screen shot of the host resolution tab">

<H4>What is it?</H4> 

The <i>host resolution</i> tab allows the execution of a host
resolution program (<tt><A HREF=man:host>host(1)</A></tt> or
<tt><A HREF=man:nslookup>nslookup(8)</A></tt>).  This host resolution
program will asks the Domain Name Server the answer to the question
asked.

<H4>Description</H4> 

This command looks for information about Internet hosts and domain
names.  It gets this information from a set of interconnected servers
that are spread across the world. This set of interconnected servers
are called the Domain Name Servers (DNS). The information is stored in
the form of <i>resource records</i> belonging to hierarchically organized
<i>zones</i>.

<p>

By default, the command simply converts between host names and
Internet addresses. However, with the <i>Search for</i> options, it
can be used to find all of the information about domain names that is
maintained by the domain name­server system.  The information printed
consists of various fields of the associated resource records that
were retrieved.

<p>

The host field can be either host names (domain names) or numeric
Internet addresses.  

<p>

A numeric Internet address consists of four decimal numbers separated
by dots, e.g. <tt>192.16.199.1</tt>, representing the four bytes of the 32-bit
address.  The default action is to look up the associated host name.

<p>

A host name or domain name consists of component names (labels)
separated by dots, e.g. <tt>nikhefh.nikhef.nl</tt>. The default action
is to look up all of its Internet addresses.

<p>

For single names without a trailing dot, the local domain is
automatically tacked on the end.  Thus a user in domain
<tt>nikhef.nl</tt> can type in <tt>nikhapo</tt>, and it will actually
look up <tt>nikhapo.nikhef.nl</tt>.  In all other cases, the name is
tried unchanged.  Single names with trailing dot are considered
top-level domain specifications, e.g. <tt>nl.</tt>

<p> 

For a more precise description of the behaviour of this command,
please see the underlying program's man-page <tt><A
HREF=man:host>host(1)</A></tt> or <tt><A
HREF=man:nslookup>nslookup(8)</A></tt>.

<p>
<u><b>Options:</b></u>
<ul>

<li><B>Search for</B><br> 

This allows you to specify a particular type of resource record
information to be looked up.  Supported types are listed below. 

<li><B>Server</B><br>

This is the name (or the address) of the domain name server to ask.

</ul>


The resource type possible are:

<table>
<tr><td> A  </td><td> the host's Internet address.</tr>
<tr><td> PTR </td><td> the host name. </tr>
<tr><td> NS </td><td> the name server for the named zone.</tr>
<tr><td> MX </td><td> the mail exchanger.</tr>
<tr><td> CNAME </td><td> the canonical name for an alias.</tr>
<tr><td> SOA </td><td> the domain's ``start-of-authority'' information.</tr>
<tr><td> <i>ANY</i> </td><td> all informations available.</tr>
</table>

<H2>Configuration</H2></A>

<IMG SRC=knu-config.gif ALT="A screen shot of the configuration dialog box">

<p>

You can configure the pathname of the command used by <i>KDE network
utilities</i> if you don't want the command found in the <tt>PATH</TT>
variable to be used or if the command in not found the the
<tt>PATH</tt>. This can be done in the Edit -&gt; Preferences...
menu. You can also add arguments to the program. For example, on Sun
Solaris computers, you can add <tt>-s</tt> as argument.

<p>

For the host resolution tab, you will have to choose the type of the
underlying command used, <tt>host</tt> or <tt>nslookup</tt>.

<p>

You can disable a command by editing the configuration file (by hand)
and in the corresponding group, just modify to read <tt>enable = 0</tt>.
