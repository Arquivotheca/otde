<h1>KDE Display Setup: Color Scheme</h1>

The Color Scheme setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<ul>
<li>1. The color scheme <b>Preview</b>.
<li>2. The current <b>Widget Color</b>.
<li>3. The available <b>Color Schemes</b>.
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> User interface elements ( e.g. buttons, menus, scroll bars )
are known as widgets.

<h2>Preview</h2>

This section of the dialog demonstrates how a color scheme applies to a
sample selection of widgets. A color scheme consists of a set of ten
colors. These colors apply to the
<ul>
<li>1.  inactive title bar background
<li>2.  inactive title bar text
<li>3.  active title bar background
<li>4.  active title bar text
<li>5.  general background
<li>6.  general foreground
<li>7.  selection background
<li>8.  selection text
<li>9.  window background
<li>10. window text
</ul>
Labels on the sample widgets will help you identify where these colors apply.

<p>

The colors are grouped into 5 foreground / background pairs. Thus, good
contrast between the foreground and background colors of widgets can be
ensured at all times.

<p>

When you press <i>Ok</i> or <i>Apply</i> the color scheme you have selected
will be written to the desktop configuration.  There are some problems in
the Qt toolkit when changing the colors in a running application, particularly
with lists and combo boxes.  These elements will not be displayed properly
until the applications are restarted.  Hopefully these problems will be
fixed in a future release of Qt.

<h2>Widget Color</h2>


The currently selected member of the color scheme is shown in the combo box
of the <b>Widget Color</b> group. This can be changed by clicking on the colored
box. A color selection dialog will then appear, from which you may select a
new color.

<p>

When you are happy with your color selection, press <i>Ok</i> in the color
selection dialog.  The color will be updated in the <b>Preview</b>.

<p>

You may select any member of the color scheme from the combo box.

<h2>Color schemes</h2>

Four color schemes are supplied with KDisplay. These are called
<ul>
<li>1.  KDE Default
<li>2.  Atlas Green
<li>3.  Blue Slate
<li>4.  Windows 95
</ul>

To preview a scheme click on its name in the list box. You can use the
supplied color schemes as a starting point to devise your own. In future it
will be possible to save these . However, in this version of KDisplay
the <i>Save</i> and <i>Remove</i> buttons are disabled.
