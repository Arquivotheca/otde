<h1>KDE Display Setup: Screen Saver</h1>

The Screen Saver setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<ul>
<li>1. The screen saver <b>Preview Monitor</b>.
<li>2. The global screen saver <b>Settings</b>.
<li>3. The <b>Screen Saver</b> to display.
</ul>

<h2>Preview Monitor</h2>

This is a minature representation of your screen saver, using the
current settings.  To apply these settings to your display, press the
<i>Apply</i> button to continue using the KDE display setup
utility or <i>Ok</i> button to apply your changes and quit.
<p>
In the corners of this monitor are four grey boxes.  These boxes indicate
what action to take if the cursor is left in one of the corners for more
than 5 seconds.  The options are:
<ul>
<li>Ignore - take no action
<li>Save - invoke the screen saver
<li>Lock - lock the screen
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Pressing <i>Ok</i> or <i>Apply</i> applies changes made in
all of the display setup modules.

<h2>Settings</h2>

Enter the time (in minutes) without activity to wait before the screen saver
is invoked.
<p>
Checking <i>Requires Password</i> will make the screen saver prompt you for
a password before restoring the screen.
<p>
<i>Priority</i> sets the "nice" value of the screen saver.

<h2>Screen Saver</h2>

To change your screen saver, select one from the list.  The screen saver will
be shown in minature in the preview monitor.
<p>
Most screen savers have settings which can be changed by clicking the
<i>Setup...</i> button.  This will display a dialog specific to the
currently selected screen saver.
<p>
The <i>Test</i> button runs the screen saver immediately, full screen.
