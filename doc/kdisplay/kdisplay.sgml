<sect>Introduction
<p>

KDisplay is a display setup utility. Running <verb> kdisplay -setup </verb>
gives a tab dialog with five pages dealing with different aspects of the
desktop display.

<enum>
<item>The desktop <bf>Background</bf>.
<item>The <bf>Screen Saver</bf>.
<item>The desktop <bf>Color Scheme</bf>.
<item><bf>General</bf> desktop preferences.
<item><bf>Input</bf> device setup.
</enum>

Running <verb>kdisplay -init</verb> simply applies your preferences to the
desktop.

<sect>Background
<p>

The Background setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The background <bf>Preview Monitor</bf>.
<item>The background <bf>Color</bf>.
<item>The background <bf>Wallpaper</bf>.
</enum>

<sect1>Preview Monitor

<p>

This is a minature representation of your display background, using the
current settings.  To apply these settings to your display, press the
<em>Apply</em> button to continue using the KDE display setup utility, or the
<em>Ok</em> button to apply your changes and quit.

<p>

<bf>Note:</bf> Pressing <em>Ok</em> or <em>Apply</em> applies changes made in
all of the display setup modules.

<sect1>Background Color

<p>

The display background can be filled with a single color or with a color
gradient.

<p>

Click the <em>Flat</em> button to fill the background with a single color.
The background color can be changed by clicking on the colored box in the
<bf>Color</bf> group.  This will display a color selection dialog from which
you may select a background color.

<p>

When you are happy with your color selection, press <em>Ok</em> in the color
selection dialog.  The color will be updated in the <bf>Preview
Monitor</bf>.  If you have a wallpaper selected, you may not see the
background color, as the wallpaper will cover it.

<p>

To fill the background with a color gradient click the <em>Gradient</em>
button. A second colored box will appear. The color gradient will run between
the colors shown in the two boxes. The gradient runs up and down the display
if  the <em>Portrait</em> option is selected. Alternatively, if the
<em>Landscape</em> option is selected, the color gradient will run across the
display.

<p>

You will not see the wallpaper when you choose a color gradient fill.

<p>

A gradient fill uses only 8 colors leaving plenty free for other
applications. However, it requires an image the size of your display to be
maintained in memory.

<sect1>Wallpaper

<p>

The wallpaper is an image displayed in the background (root window) of your
display.  To change the wallpaper displayed, select one from the list
or click the <em>Browse</em> button and select an image.

<p>

The image may be: <em>Tiled</em>, <em>Centred</em>, or <em>Scaled</em> to fit
the size of the display.

<p>

Displaying wallpaper requires that the image be kept memory.  If you are low
on memory, using a small, tiled image or none at all is recommended. Note
that scaling or centring a small image still requires an image the size of
your display to be maintained in memory.

<sect>Screen Saver
<p>

The Screen Saver setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The screen saver <bf>Preview Monitor</bf>.
<item>The global screen saver <bf>Settings</bf>.
<item>The <bf>Screen Saver</bf> to display.
</enum>

<sect1>Preview Monitor
<p>

This is a minature representation of your screen saver, using the current
settings.  To apply these settings to your display, press the <em>Apply</em>
button to continue using the KDE display setup utility or <em>Ok</em> button
to apply your changes and quit.

<p>

In the corners of this monitor are four grey boxes.  These boxes indicate
what action to take if the cursor is left in one of the corners for more than
5 seconds.  The options are:

<itemize>
<item>Ignore - take no action
<item>Save - invoke the screen saver
<item>Lock - lock the screen
</itemize>

<p>

<bf>Note:</bf> Pressing <em>Ok</em> or <em>Apply</em> applies changes made in
all of the display setup modules.

<sect1>Settings
<p>

Enter the time (in minutes) without activity to wait before the screen saver
is invoked.

<p>

Checking <em>Requires Password</em> will make the screen saver prompt you for
a password before restoring the screen.

<p>

<em>Priority</em> sets the "nice" value of the screen saver.

<sect1>Screen Saver
<p>

To change your screen saver, select one from the list.  The screen saver will
be shown in minature in the preview monitor.

<p>

Most screen savers have settings which can be changed by clicking the
<em>Setup...</em> button.  This will display a dialog specific to the
currently selected screen saver.

<p>

The <em>Test</em> button runs the screen saver immediately, full screen.

<sect>Color Scheme
<p>

The Color Scheme setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The color scheme <bf>Preview</bf>.
<item>The current <bf>Widget Color</bf>.
<item>The available <bf>Color Schemes</bf>.
</enum>

<bf>Note:</bf> User interface elements ( e.g. buttons, menus, scroll bars )
are known as widgets.

<sect1>Preview
<p>

This section of the dialog demonstrates how a color scheme applies to a
sample selection of widgets. A color scheme consists of a set of ten
colors. These colors apply to the :-

<enum>
<item>Inactive title bar background
<item>Inactive title bar text
<item>Active title bar background
<item>Active title bar text
<item>General background
<item>General foreground
<item>Selection background
<item>Selection text
<item>Window background
<item>Window text
</enum>

Labels on the sample widgets will help you identify where these colors apply.

<p>

The colors are grouped into 5 foreground / background pairs. Thus, good
contrast between the foreground and background colors of widgets can be
ensured at all times.

<p>

When you press <em>Ok</em> or <em>Apply</em> the color scheme you have selected
will be written to the desktop configuration.  There are some problems in
the Qt toolkit when changing the colors in a running application, particularly
with lists and combo boxes.  These elements will not be displayed properly
until the applications are restarted.  Hopefully these problems will be
fixed in a future release of Qt.

<sect1>Widget Color
<p>

The currently selected member of the color scheme is shown in the combo box
of the <bf>Widget Color</bf> group. This can be changed by clicking on the
colored box. A color selection dialog will then appear, from which you may
select a new color.

<p>

When you are happy with your color selection, press <em>Ok</em> in the color
selection dialog.  The color will be updated in the <bf>Preview</bf>.

<p>

You may select any member of the color scheme from the combo box.

<sect1>Color schemes
<p>

Six color schemes are supplied with KDisplay. These are called
<enum>
<item>KDE Default
<item>Atlas Green
<item>Blue Slate
<item>Windows 95
<item>CDE
<item>Pale Gray
</enum>

To preview a scheme click on its name in the list box. You can use the
supplied color schemes as a starting point to devise your own. Click the 
<em>Save</em> button to store your color scheme under a new name. The
<em>Remove</em> button is presently disabled.

<sect>General
<p>

The General setup dialog is comprised of two sections:

<enum>
<item>The <bf>Widget style</bf> box.
<item>The <bf>Fonts</bf> selection dialog.
</enum>

<sect1>Widget Style
<p>

This allows you to switch between a Motif look or a Windows 95 look for the K
Desktop Environment.  Currently, Qt does not adjust combo boxes properly when
the widget style is changed.

<sect1>Fonts
<p>

You may change the font for the desktop.  This option has only recently been
enabled in all KDE applications, therefore some applications may not behave
correctly when their fonts are changed, or if a large font is used.

<sect>Input
<p>

The Input setup dialog is comprised of two sections:

<enum>
<item>The <bf>Keyboard</bf> group.
<item>The <bf>Mouse</bf> group.
</enum>

<sect1>Keyboard
<p>

This allows customisation of the keyboard.  The <em>Auto Repeat</em>
check box controls the behaviour when a key is help pressed.  If
<em>Auto Repeat</em> is on then the key will be outputted repeatedly
until you release the key.
<p>
The <em>Repeat Delay</em> is the time to wait before the first key press
is repeated.
<p>
The <em>Repeat Rate</em> is how quickly more key presses should be generated
after the first repeat.
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> Only the XFree86 X server supports <em>Repeat Delay</em> and
<em>Repeat Rate</em> (though I couldn't make it work on my machine - if
this works for you please let me know).

<sect1>Mouse
<p>

<em>Acceleration</em> sets the speed the pointer should move after the
mouse has moved faster than the <em>Threshold</em>.
