<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Installing kdm</A></H2>

<P>See the file README! It will tell you how to compile kdm.
<B>NOTE:</B> <CODE>make install</CODE> will overwrite your previous <CODE>kdmrc</CODE>.</P>
<P>Then you should insert the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
kdmdesktop
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

in the file called <CODE>XSetup_0</CODE> or similar in the xdm config directory
(often <CODE>/etc/X11/xdm/XSetup_0</CODE>). Make sure the path is set,
so that <CODE>kdmdesktop</CODE> can be executed.</P>
<P>If you chose the PAM option, then you should check
/etc/pam.conf for the lines
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# xdm authorization
xdm    auth       required     pam_unix_auth.so
xdm    auth       required     pam_unix_acct.so
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and insert them, if they aren't there.</P>
<P>Now it's time to test kdm. You should bring your system to a runlevel
that doesn't run xdm and try (as root) to say:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&gt; kdm -nodaemon
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you get a kdm login box and you are able to log in, things are great.
The main thing that can go wrong here, is that the runtime linker might
not find the shared Qt or KDE libraries. When everything works, then edit
/etc/inittab to execute kdm instead of xdm. If you have a binary
distribution of the KDE libraries, it might be nescesary to tell kdm
where kde is installed (if the location of kde isn't found, icons will
miss). This is done with the "kdm -kdedir /path/to/kde"
option (note that KDEDIR cant be set if kdm is started from inittab).
If you dont like changing inittab,
you might instead rename xdm to xdm.bak and make xdm a symlink to kdm.
Kdm will read the general display manager settings from the xdm configuartion
files and the kdm specific ones from the file
$KDEDIR/config/kdmrc. Kdmdesktop will also read kdmrc.</P>
