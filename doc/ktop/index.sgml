<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KTop
<p>
KTop is part of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KEdit can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KTop, you need the latest versions of
the kde libraries. All required libraries as well as KTop itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KTop on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KTop distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KTop uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.
