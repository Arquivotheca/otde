    <h1>KWM Documentation</h1>
	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>This documentation may be incomplete. For further questions how
	  to customize 
	  kwm at a low level (only interesting for the kwinconfig
	  developers....)  please have a look at the generated kwmrc and the
	  source code.</p>
	
	<p>	For all programmers: check out <code>kwm.h</code> in
	  libkdecore for lots of 
	  informations about how to use kwm for your purposes. For modules
	  the class <code>KWMModuleApplication</code> (maybe some day in
	  libkdecore, at 
	  present used and defined by krootwm) is also a good example on how
	  to write modules.</p>


	<h2>FAQ</H2>
	<ol>
	  <li>
		<p>Why should I use kwm? I spent several days in learning how to
		  configure 10 different windowmangers. And now that I have a 678
		  lines resource file doing exactly what I want, you are coming
		  along and want to take my windowmanager away!</p>
		
		<p>Answer: You <em>should</em> not, it is only a <em>free</em>
		  offer. But IMHO your are making a mistake if not ;-)</p>
		
		<p>Some arguments:</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>shameless integration into KDE</li>
		  <li>2nd generation windowmanager, i.e. it uses a modern GUI
			toolkit for its widgets (buttons, menus, listboxes, etc) instead
			of bloating the code with a proprietary unconvenient plain Xlib
			implementation.</li>
		  <li>modern and pretty look and <em>feel</em> with unique window
			titles and icons which do not need to be defined in cryptic
			resource files.</li>
		  <li>can be configured at runtime without the need to
			restart it</li> 
		  <li>complete keyboard control</li>
		  <li>excellent focus handling even if you work on different virtual
			desktops (no longer desktop-switching-and-losing-focus like it is
			standard with other window managers)</li>
		  <li>includes session management and a really working session
			management proxy for older applications. This proxy is able to
			restore your applications exactly, that means with the correct
			window properties (maximized, sticky, iconified, etc.) on the
			correct virtual desktop.</li> 
		  <li>modern module concept that uses X wherever it is
			possible. Also, kwm modules are very independent: They can be
			started before or after kwm. kwm can even be restarted while
			the modules are still running and will reconnect them
			automatically.</li> 
		  <li>offers some extensions to X in <code>kwm.h</code>: Now
			applications can 
			even maximize themselves (or sticky, or decorate/undecorate or
			whatever) and define mini icons. This works also for mapped
			(visible) windows!</li><br>
		</ul>
	  </li>

	  <li>
		<p>Why can't I define new shortcuts for launching applications or
		do whatever? This is very important for me!</p>
		
		<p>Answer: Because this is not the task of the
		  windowmanger. Use <code>KGlobalShortcut</code> for this
		  purpose.</p> 
	  </li>
	
	  <li>
		<p>Why does kwm look so much like Windows 95?</p>
		
		<p>Answer: Ooops, does it? Let me see.... (Matthias trying to
		find somebody 
		who has Windows 95 because he does not have any windows on all his
		computers... Damn... nobody has windows here. Well let's grab an old
		Linux distribution and install fvwm95-2.....) No, I cannot verify
		that at all. kwm looks much prettier and offers more core 
		window management functionality :-)<p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
		<p>Is it possible to add the KDE extensions to other
		windowmanagers?</p> 
		
		<p>Answer: Yes it is. You simple have to go through
		  <code>kwm.h</code>/<code>kwm.C</code> from libkdecore and
		  extend your favorite 
		  windowmanager to respond correctly to these requests. BTW it
		  is also possible to implement an object request broker in
		  x86 assembler. It's just a question of the investment/result
		  ratio.</P> 
	  </li>

	<h2>Mouse control</h2>
	<dl>
	  <dt>click onto the border or the titlebar:</dt>

		window is active, otherwise activate it without raising.</dd>

	  <dt>doubleclick on title toggles maximize</dt>

	  <dt>drag of the titlebar</dt>

	</dl>

	<h2>Low-level configuration (kwmrc)</h2>
	<p>Please note that users need not change these
	  options in the <code>kwmrc</code> file; they can use the Control
	  Center instead 
	  which provides	access to all these configuration options via a
	  nice GUI. See the <a href="desktop.html">Quickstart Guide</a> for
	  information about how to use the Control Center.</p>
