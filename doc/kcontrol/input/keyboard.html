<h2>
Configuring the keyboard properties
</h2>

<p>
The keyboard settings are features of the X server,
which attempts to make good use of the available hardware. However,
it isn't always possible for the X server to actually supply all
the functions. For example, on some systems the key click is enabled
or disabled in the CMOS setup and the X server does not supply an
alternative. Thus, if a setting doesn't seem to do anything, this 
is because the X server and/or the hardware don't support anything 
better.

<p>
User's are able to set the following parameters for the keyboard:

<ul>
<li>enable/disable autorepeat
<li>key click volume
</ul>

<p>
In order to make the settings persist from one X session to another,
the command "kcc -init" must be run (usually from the .xinitrc file).
The old method (~/Desktop/Autostart/keyboard_setup.sh) is no longer
needed and that shell script should be deleted.
