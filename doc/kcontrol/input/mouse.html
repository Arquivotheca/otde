<h2>
Configuring the mouse
</h2>

<p>
User's are able to set the following parameters for the bell:

<ul>
<li>accelerated movement rate
<li>threshold for accelerated movement
</ul>

<p>
For threshold gives the distance the pointer must move (in a small
amount of time) before accelerated movement occurs. In this mode,
the pointer moves some factor faster than normal, relative to the
amount the user actually moves the pointing device. The factor
is the accelerated movement rate. These settings allow for slow, 
precise pointer motion over small distances and rapid motion across 
the screen with a short but quick motion. Large acceleration
values and small threshold values may make the pointer too jumpy
to be useful, as it will always move very quickly.

<p>
In order to make the settings persist from one X session to another,
the command "kcc -init" must be run (usually from the .xinitrc file).
The old method (~/Desktop/Autostart/mouse_setup.sh) is no longer
needed and that shell script should be deleted.
