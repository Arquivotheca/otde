<sect>Introduction

<p>
Activating ``<bf>enable system sounds</bf>''
allows sounds to be assigned to
the various
system  events listed in the <bf>Events</bf> box.
When such an event (like ``Window open'') occurs, the
sound file that has been associated to that event will be played.

<p>
Currently, only WAV files are supported by the KDE System Sound
Module. The default location of such WAV files is the directory
$(KDEDIR)/share/sounds, and any WAV files available there will be
listed in the <bf>Sounds</bf> box.
You can also add other sound files to the Sounds list by,
just dragging them from a <tt>kfm</tt> window onto the sound list. 


To associate a sound to an event, use the pointer to
highlight its entry in the Sounds list.  (You may now hear it by
clicking on the <bf>Test</bf> button.)   Then highlight the corresponding
event you wish to associate with it and click on <bf>Apply</bf> (or
<bf>OK</bf> if you are finished).






<sect>Changes

<p>
Version 0.0.3 (Nov. 22nd, 1997)

- uses KApplication::localconfigdir()

- fixed a bug that messed up the assignments of system sounds to 
  events in some cases when WAV files were dropped on the sound list

- initial help page written

- german nationalisation added. (email me if you want to add
  antother language to syssound).

- syssounds is now based on kexample-0.5.1. This and the move to
  the kcontrol interface finally removed the compile problems

- prepared syssound.cpp for internationalisation (thanks
  to Matthias Hoelzer)

- Adapted syssound to the new kcontrol interface that replaces
  kcc now, so syssound works with the current kde snapshots
  now. (thanks to Matthias Hoelzer)

Version 0.0.2 (Oct. 21st, 1997)

- Moved README from "syssound/syssound" to "syssound"
  and updated it a bit.

- Moved the file "COMPILING.TXT" from "syssound/syssound"
  to "syssound".

- Made the placement of the configuration file compliant
  with the new KDE convention. The sound configuration 
  is now stored in $HOME/.kde/share/config/kwmsoundrc

- Brushed up the look of the config dialog a bit. It
  now supports keyboard accelerators and has 
  labels for the listboxes.

- Added support for Droping WAV Files onto the WAV
  Filelist (currently, only file:/ URLs are supported,
  .WAV Files are recognized by the extension ".wav"
  (in small letters).

- Sound configuration now works with KDE Beta1 too
  (no more "pure virtual function called" or
  "only root can run this module" error messages.

Version 0.0.1 (initial release)
