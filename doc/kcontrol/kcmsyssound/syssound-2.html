<P>Version 0.0.3 (Nov. 22nd, 1997)
<P>- uses KApplication::localconfigdir()
<P>- fixed a bug that messed up the assignments of system sounds to 
events in some cases when WAV files were dropped on the sound list
<P>- initial help page written
<P>- german nationalisation added. (email me if you want to add
antother language to syssound).
<P>- syssounds is now based on kexample-0.5.1. This and the move to
the kcontrol interface finally removed the compile problems
<P>- prepared syssound.cpp for internationalisation (thanks
to Matthias Hoelzer)
<P>- Adapted syssound to the new kcontrol interface that replaces
kcc now, so syssound works with the current kde snapshots
now. (thanks to Matthias Hoelzer)
<P>Version 0.0.2 (Oct. 21st, 1997)
<P>- Moved README from "syssound/syssound" to "syssound"
and updated it a bit.
<P>- Moved the file "COMPILING.TXT" from "syssound/syssound"
to "syssound".
<P>- Made the placement of the configuration file compliant
with the new KDE convention. The sound configuration 
is now stored in $HOME/.kde/share/config/kwmsoundrc
<P>- Brushed up the look of the config dialog a bit. It
now supports keyboard accelerators and has 
labels for the listboxes.
<P>- Added support for Droping WAV Files onto the WAV
Filelist (currently, only file:/ URLs are supported,
.WAV Files are recognized by the extension ".wav"
(in small letters).
<P>- Sound configuration now works with KDE Beta1 too
(no more "pure virtual function called" or
"only root can run this module" error messages.
<P>Version 0.0.1 (initial release)
