<sect>Configuration of System Sounds.

<p>
This screen allows ``<bf>System Sounds</bf>'' to be configured,
so that when one of certain <bf>Events</bf> (such as
opening a window, changing the desktop, etc.) occurs, a sound file
associated with that event is played.
<p>
Currently, only WAV sound files are supported by the 
KDE System Sound Module.    


<itemize>
<item>
Select ``<bf>enable system sounds</bf>'' to activate
this feature.
</itemize>

To use this feature, you must first have some
WAV files listed in the <bf>Sounds</bf> box.   This will list
files from the default location
<tt>$KDEDIR/share/sounds</tt>; the user can add additional
WAV files to the list by 
dragging them from a File Manager (<tt>kfm</tt>) window onto the sound list. 

(Note: at this time,  
the standard KDE distribution does not supply any WAV
files for system sounds; you must obtain them from some other
source such as the ``kdethemes'' package).

<itemize>
<item>
To associate a sound to an event, use the pointer to
highlight its entry in the <bf>Sounds</bf> list.  (You may now hear the
selected sound  by
clicking on the <bf>Test</bf> button.)   Then highlight the
entry in the <bf>Events</bf> list that 
you wish to associate with it and click on <bf>Apply</bf> (or
<bf>OK</bf> if you are finished).
</itemize>
