<h2>
Configuring the kwm titlebar
</h2>

<p>
This dialog configures some settings of <em>kwm</em>, the KDE
window manager. The currently available options are:

<ul>
<li>place titlebar buttons on the left or right side of the titlebar
<li>disable and hide titlebar buttons
<li>select shaded vs. plain appearance
<li>titlebar animation?
</ul>

<p>
The placement of buttons on each side of the titlebar follows a simple
rule: buttons which are higher up in the list appear <em>inside</em>
or near the middle of the window relative to buttons that are farther
down on the list. This allows for most sensible button arrangements.

<p>
Since a maximum of three (3) buttons are allowed on each side of the
titlebar, trying to place a fourth button on either side will cause the
innermost one to be switched off.

<p>
The shading scheme that is used by kwm for the shaded titlebar
option does not show up in the titlebar preview, so you have to
select Apply to see it. Sorry :-)

<p>
Enabling "titlebar animation" tells kwm to cause long window titles (too
long to fit in the colored area of the titlebar) to slide back and forth
in order to be visible.
