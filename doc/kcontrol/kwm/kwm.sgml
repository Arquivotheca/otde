<sect>Configuring the kwm titlebar

<p>
This dialog configures some settings of <em>kwm</em>, the KDE
window manager. The currently available options are:

<itemize>
<item>place titlebar buttons on the left or right side of the titlebar
<item>disable and hide titlebar buttons
<item>select shaded vs. plain appearance
<item>titlebar animation?
</itemize>

<p>
The placement of buttons on each side of the titlebar follows a simple
rule: buttons which are higher up in the list appear <em>inside</em>
or near the middle of the window relative to buttons that are farther
down on the list. This allows for most sensible button arrangements.

<p>
Since a maximum of three (3) buttons are allowed on each side of the
titlebar, trying to place a fourth button on either side will cause the
innermost one to be switched off.

<p>
The shading scheme that is used by kwm for the shaded titlebar
option does not show up in the titlebar preview, so you have to
select Apply to see it. Sorry :-)

<p>
Enabling "titlebar animation" tells kwm to cause long window titles (too
long to fit in the colored area of the titlebar) to slide back and forth
in order to be visible. 

<sect>Configuring window properties
<p>
The window manager supports the following window-manipulation
features:

<itemize>window moving: transparent or opaque
<item>window resizing: animated or instant
<item>window maximizing: expand to full screen or just expand vertically
<item>focus policy: click or follow mouse
<item>auto raise: window will be raised automatically
</itemize>

<p>
Transparent window movement mode supplies a wireframe of the window
which the user can place, while opaque movement mode means the contents
of the window remain visible while it is being moved.

<p>
The resizing animation looks really cool. Try it.

<p>
The window that is "in focus" receives keyboard input and has the
active titlebar appearance (usually colored instead of gray). The
focus can be switched to another window with the keyboard (Alt-TAB)
or the mouse. If "click to focus" is selected, the user must click
in the new window to give it the focus. If "focus follows mouse"
is selected, the focus switches to a widnow as soon as the pointer
enters it. This makes focus switching without raising a window easier,
but at the expense that the position of the pointer is important even
when the pointer isn't being used. Note that kwm uses what is called
"sloppy focus" in the latter mode: a window stay in focus after the
pointer leaves if the pointer has not entered another window and given
it the focus (i.e. the deskop or root window and kpanel do not get
the focus).

<p>
Auto raise serves to bring a window to the front (top) when it gets the
focus. This mode applies to "focus follows mouse" policy only. Auto raise
can be disabled by setting the delay to zero (0).
