<P>The window manager supports the following window-manipulation
features:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>window moving: transparent or opaque</LI>
<LI>window resizing: animated or instant</LI>
<LI>window maximizing: expand to full screen or just expand vertically</LI>
<LI>focus policy: click or follow mouse</LI>
<LI>auto raise: window will be raised automatically</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Transparent window movement mode supplies a wireframe of the window
which the user can place, while opaque movement mode means the contents
of the window remain visible while it is being moved.
<P>
<P>The resizing animation looks really cool. Try it.
<P>
<P>The window that is "in focus" receives keyboard input and has the
active titlebar appearance (usually colored instead of gray). The
focus can be switched to another window with the keyboard (Alt-TAB)
or the mouse. If "click to focus" is selected, the user must click
in the new window to give it the focus. If "focus follows mouse"
is selected, the focus switches to a widnow as soon as the pointer
enters it. This makes focus switching without raising a window easier,
but at the expense that the position of the pointer is important even
when the pointer isn't being used. Note that kwm uses what is called
"sloppy focus" in the latter mode: a window stay in focus after the
pointer leaves if the pointer has not entered another window and given
it the focus (i.e. the deskop or root window and kpanel do not get
the focus).
<P>
<P>Auto raise serves to bring a window to the front (top) when it gets the
focus. This mode applies to "focus follows mouse" policy only. Auto raise
can be disabled by setting the delay to zero (0).
