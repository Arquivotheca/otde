<sect>Location and Style of the  Panel and Taskbar.

<p>
The <em>Panel</em> contains the <em>Application
Starter</em> button, buttons for selecting between virtual
desktops, a clock, and various other swallowed icons
placed there by default or by the user.
<itemize>
<item>
The <bf>Location</bf> buttons select which
side of the screen the Panel is attached to. Choices
are: <bf> top</bf>,
<bf> left side</bf>, or <bf> bottom</bf>.
<item>
The <bf>Taskbar</bf> displays a list of running applications.
It can be 
<bf>hidden</bf>,
displayed horizontally along the <bf>top</bf> or <bf>bottom</bf> 
of the screen,
or vertically downwards from the  <bf>top/left</bf> corner.
<item>
The <bf>Style</bf> buttons choose  between three sizes of the panel:
<bf>Tiny</bf>, <bf>Normal</bf>, or <bf>Large</bf>.  This choice 
affects the size of icons used in the panel, and the placement of
virtual desktop buttons, etc.
</itemize>

<sect> Panel Options.
<p>
<itemize>
<item>
<bf>Menu Tooltips</bf>
are a boxes containing a short descriptive text that appear
(after a short delay) when the mouse pointer is placed over
a button on the Panel or an entry in the Application Starter
list.    If you enable Tooltips, you can use the slider
to  set the delay
before they appear.
<item>
<bf>Personal First</bf>:  
Choosing this makes your custom entries in the user
section of the Application Starter the
<em>primary  entries </em> on the menu.
(The default makes the KDE application entries primary).
<item> <bf>Auto Hide Panel</bf>: With this choice
the Panel is normally hidden, but reappears when you
touch the side of the screen where the Panel is hidden
with the mouse pointer.
<item> <bf>Auto Hide Taskbar</bf>: 
This choice similarly auto-hides the Taskbar. It also
reappears when the side of the screen where it is hidden is 
touched
by the mouse pointer.
<item>
The <bf> Clock</bf> may be configured for either
<bf>24 hour</bf> or <bf>12 hour (AM/PM) </bf> styles.
</itemize>

<sect>Configuring Virtual Desktops
<p>
Up to eight <em>Virtual Desktops </em> may be configured.
The number chosen is shown by the  number of 
open boxes that are displayed.   
There will be a button on
the Panel corresponding to each Virtual Desktop.  
Text entered in an open  box appears as a label
on the corresponding button.

The <bf>Visible</bf> slider choses  the number of
Virtual Desktops to be configured.
(Possible choices are 2,4,6, or 8).  

<p>
The <bf> Width </bf> slider adjusts the width of the
Virtual Desktop buttons on the Panel.  (Choose them
wide enough to accomodate the text with which
you labeled them.)
