<H3><A NAME="s2">2. Panel Options.</A></H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Menu Tooltips</B>
Tooltips are small descriptive hints that appear
after a short delay when the mouse pointer is over
a button on the Panel or an entry in the Application Starter
list.  If you enable Tooltips, you can use the slider
to set the <B>delay</B> before they appear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>``<B>Visuals</B>'' means settings that allow the Panel and Taskbar
dynamic ``autohide'' feature to be controlled:
<UL>
<LI>If <B>Auto Hide Panel</B> is selected, the Panel will ``hide''
below the bottom edge of the screen, until this edge is touched
with the mouse pointer.  It will then reappear, and if the mouse 
pointer is removed, it will ``hide'' again after a delay set by the
<B>Delay</B> slider; the speed at which the Panel moves into and
out of the hidden position is set by the <B>Speed</B> slider
on the right.   This feature allows the panel to be available 
when needed, without otherwise obscuring a region of the visible
screen.
</LI>
<LI>If <B>Auto Hide Taskbar</B> is selected, the Taskbar will
behave in a similar fashion: it ``hides'' behind the edge of the screen along
which it has been placed, and reappears when its hiding place is touched with
the mouse pointer. The delay before it hides again, and the speed with which
it moves into and out of hiding, are set with the 
<B>Delay</B> and <B>Speed</B> slider controls.
</LI>
<LI>The Panel (but not the Taskbar) has a second feature that allows it to
be moved out of the visible region of the screen.  If one of the two
arrows at each end of the Panel is clicked on, the Panel  disappears by
moving parallel to the edge of the screen in the direction of
this arrow, until only the other arrow is visible;
the Panel will only be restored when the second arrow is clicked on.
If <B>Animate Show/Hide</B> is selected, this motion takes place
smoothly, with a <B>Speed</B> that is controlled by the slider
control; otherwise, the disappearance/reappearance of the Panel
is instantaneous.  </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P><B>Other</B> options control the placement of the user's personal
entries in the  Application Starter menu that appears
when the big <B>K</B> button is selected.
The default configuration places the system's KDE applications
as the first entries in the Application Starter menu, followed by a
``Personal'' menu containing the  entries which are personal to
the user (and set in the user's own <CODE>~/.kde/share/applnk/</CODE>
directory).  
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 
Selecting <B>Menu Personal Menu Entries First</B> places the user's
entries first in the Application Starter Menu, followed by a ``default''
menu which contains the system's KDE applications.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The default placement of the items in the user's Personal Menu
Entries is to list individual application entries in
<CODE>~/.kde/share/applnk/</CODE> first, followed by a list of Menu Folders
in which collections  of application entries can be placed (e.g.,
those created when the user runs the <B>Appfinder</B> in the
System menu).
<UL>
<LI>Selecting <B>Menu Folders First</B> causes the folders in the
user's Personal Menu Entries to be shown first, before those individual
entries in the user's Personal Menu  which are not in folders.</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Panel clock format</B>.
The panel displays the current time and date.   By default, the time is
in 24 hour time format.  Other posible selections are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Clock shows time in AM/PM format.</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Clock shows time in Internet beats.</B></LI>
</UL>

<EM>``Internet time''</EM> is  a new ``universal'' time format promoted by 
the Swatch watch company,
where the 24 hour day is divided into 1000 ``beats'', measured from
midnight  UTC+1 (GMT+1), so noon UTC+1 is written as
``@500'' Internet time.
(@000 means midnight, winter time,  at Biel, Switzerland, the location of
the company headquarters,).
