<sect>KDE Theme Manager: Installer
<p>
The KDE Theme Manager <bf>Installer</bf>
screen allows you to select the desktop <bf>Theme</bf>
package you wish to install. 

Installation of a <bf>Theme</bf> package customizes the appearance
of your desktop by modifying
some or all of the following: 

<itemize>

<item> Colors and Wallpapers, 
panel appearance,
sounds associated with events,
standard icons,
window appearance (borders, titlebar, buttons), etc.

</itemize>


The column on the left lists the available  <bf>Theme</bf> packages.
The packages shown are either <em>global themes</em>
in the system Themes directory
<tt>$KDEDIR/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</tt>  or
<em>local themes</em> in your personal
Themes directory <tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</tt>.
The packages can either be <tt>tar</tt> archives
compressed with <tt>gzip</tt>, or unpacked directories.

The ``Default'' Theme is the plain (themeless) KDE Desktop.

Click on a listed Theme to select it; its name will be
highlighted and  a picture  showing its  components
will be displayed in the central  box.   Information
about the Theme will be displayed in the lower  box. 

Clicking on  <bf>Default</bf> will select the 
``Default'' Theme.

When you select a Theme package
its contents will be extracted  and placed in your Theme Manager
Work directory <tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Work</tt>.
(The previous contents of this directory will be deleted.)

After selecting a Theme,
go to the next screen (<bf>Contents</bf>) to
choose which  components of the Theme package to
install.  When you have made your choice, click on <bf>Apply</bf>
to install the  selected components, which will be copied from
your Theme Manager Work directory.

To quit the Theme Manager, click on <bf>OK</bf> to
apply the current Theme selection and then exit, or
click on <bf>Cancel</bf> to exit without installing
a new Theme.
 


Theme packages can be imported, exported, created, or deleted
using the buttons
at the right:
<itemize>

<item> Click on ``<bf>Add</bf>'' to import a new theme package into your
local Themes directory.  You will be prompted for the name and
location
of the package.

<item> Click on ``<bf>Save as</bf>'' to export the contents
of your local Theme Manager Work directory as a new theme
package. 
You will be prompted for the location at  which to save it
(as a compressed <tt>tar</tt> archive).



<item> Click on ``<bf>Create</bf>'' to create a new entry in the list.
This creates a new Theme package in the local Theme Manager Work directory.  
It will initially be a copy of the currently-installed Theme package; 
you can then modify it as desired.


 
<item> Click on ``<bf>Remove</bf>'' to delete a local Theme.
(This button is inactive when a global Theme is highlighted.)

</itemize>


<sect> Theme package contents
<p>
The <bf>Contents</bf> screen presents a list of the components 
contained in the selected 
Theme package.
It also allows you to choose which of these
components to install.


Not all possible components are
necessarily present in a given
Theme package.
Components that are present are
listed as ``<bf>available</bf>'';
missing components are listed as <bf>``empty''</bf>.

The checkbox ``<bf>Uninstall parts of previous theme</bf>'' determines
how missing components are handled when a Theme package is installed:
<itemize>
<item> If the box is <bf>not</bf> checked, those components of the
previously-installed Theme which are not supplied by the new
Theme package are left in place.
<item> If the box is checked, all components of the previous
Theme are removed.
</itemize>
If you wish to remove all Theme components by installing the
``Default''  Theme (a themeless Desktop), this box must be checked.
(The Default theme has <bf>no</bf> Theme components.)


Each Theme component also has a checkbox next to it.
If the box next to a component listed  as ``<bf>available</bf>''
is checked, that component will be installed when the
<bf>Apply</bf> or <bf>OK</bf> button is clicked.
Components with unchecked boxes will not be installed.


The <bf>Clear</bf> button clears all the checkboxes for the list of
Theme components, and the <bf>Invert</bf> button  exchanges checked and
unchecked items.

<itemize>
<item> Note: the image files for the Window Titlebar and Window Border
components are installed into the directory
<tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kwm/pics/</tt>
and Panel image files go in
<tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kpanel/pics/</tt>.
If you find you are unable to 
completely remove a Theme to restore the
default desktop,  
delete the contents
of these directories.

</itemize>
