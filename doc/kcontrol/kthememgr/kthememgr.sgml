<sect>KDE Theme Manager: Installer
<p>
This KDE Theme Manager screen allows you to select the desktop <bf>Theme</bf>
package you wish to install. 

Installation of a <bf>Theme</bf> package customizes the appearance
of your desktop by modifying
some or all of the following: 

<itemize>

<item> Colors and Wallpapers, 
panel appearance,
sounds associated with events,
standard icons,
window appearance (borders, titlebar, buttons), etc.

</itemize>


The column on the left lists the available  <bf>Theme</bf> packages.
The packages shown are either <em>global themes</em>
in the system Themes directory
<tt>$KDEDIR/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</tt>  or
<em>local themes</em> in your personal
Themes directory <tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</tt>.
The packages can either be gzipped tarballs or unpacked directories.


Click on a listed Theme to select it; its name will be
highlighted and (if available)  a picture  showing its  components
will be displayed in the central  box.   Information
about the Theme will be displayed in the lower  box. 

To activate the highlighted theme package, click on <bf>Apply</bf>.
The contents of the package will be extracted to  your Theme manager
Work directory <tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Work</tt>, and the various
components will be copied to the KDE configuration directories which
control the desktop.    (Go to the  <bf>Contents</bf> screen to
select which  components of the Theme package to activate)




Clicking on <bf>OK</bf> will also apply the selected  Theme package, and
then close the Theme Manager.


Clicking on  <bf>Default</bf> will restore the default theme-less
KDE desktop.


<itemize>
<item> Note: the image files for the various window  elements
(buttons, titlebar, etc.) are placed in the directory
<tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kwm/pics/</tt>
and panel elements go in
<tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kpanel/pics/</tt>.
If you are unable to 
completely remove a Theme to restore the
default desktop, you may need to delete the contents
of these directories.

</itemize>


Themes can be imported, exported, created, or deleted
using the buttons
at the right:
<itemize>

<item> Click on ``<bf>Add</bf>'' to import a new theme package to your
local Themes directory.  You will be prompted for the name and
location
of the package.

<item> Click on ``<bf>Save as</bf>'' to export the highlighted theme
package.  You will be propted for the location at  which to save it.


<item> Click on ``<bf>Create</bf>'' to create a new entry in the list.
This creates a new Theme package in the local Work directory.  
It will initially be a copy of the currently-highlighted Theme package; 
you can then modify it as desired.


 
<item> Click on ``<bf>Remove</bf>'' to delete a local Theme.
(This button is inactive when a global Theme is highlighted.)

</itemize>


<sect> Theme package contents
<p>
This screen lists the elements contained in the selected Theme package.
and allows their selective installation to replace the 
corresponding elements
of the Theme that is currently being used.


If the checkbox <bf>Uninstall parts of previous theme</bf> is
selected,  the  previous theme files in the KDE configuration
directories will be backed up with a 
<tt>~</tt>  extension;  if the box is not checked, they
will be overwritten.  


A list of the possible elements of the Theme package is presented
(Colors, Wallpapers, Panel, ... etc.).   Each has a checkbox next to it,
and is identified as <bf>available</bf> or <bf>empty</bf>,
depending on whether or not this element is present
in  the  highlighted theme package listed on the previous (Installer) screen.
(Some Theme packages only contain a subset of the possible Theme elements.)

If they are listed as <bf>available</bf>, 
the checked  items in this list of possible Theme elements will
be installed into the appropriate
KDE configuration directories when the <bf>Apply</bf> button is clicked.
If items are left unchecked, the corresponding elements of the 
currently-running Theme package will be left unchanged when the <bf>Apply</bf>
button is clicked.



The <bf>Clear</bf> button clears all the checkboxes for the list of
Theme elements, and the <bf>Invert</bf>  exchanges checked and
unchecked items.




<sect> About the package.
<p>
This screen provides information (version, author, etc.)
about the selected Theme package, and about the KDE Theme Manager.
