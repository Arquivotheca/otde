<sect>KDE Theme Manager: Installer
<p>
This KDE Theme Manager screen allows you to select the desktop <bf>Theme</bf>
package you wish to install. 

 <bf>Themes</bf> customize some
or all of:  the 
appearance of  the various screen elements 
(window borders, buttons, title bar, panel, etc.), 
the color scheme and background wall papers,
sounds associated with various events. and standard icons. 



The column on the left lists the available  <bf>Theme</bf> packages.
The packages shown are either <em>global themes</em>
in the system Themes directory
<tt>$KDEDIR/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</tt>  or
<em>local themes</em> in your personal
Themes directory <tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</tt>.
The packages can either be gzipped tarballs or unpacked directories.


Click on a listed Theme to select it; its name will be
highlighted and (if available)  a picture  showing its  components
will be displayed in the top right-hand box.   Information
about the Theme will be displayed in the lower right-hand box. 

To activate the highlighted theme package, click on <bf>Apply</bf>.
The contents of the package will be extracted to  your Theme manager
Work directory <tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Work</tt>, and the various
components will be copied to the KDE configuration directories which
control the desktop.    (Go to the next <bf>Contents</bf> screen to
select which  components of the Themes package to activate)



<itemize>
<item> Note: the image files for the various window  elements
(buttons, titlebar, etc.) are placed in the directory
<tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kwm/pics/</tt>
and panel elements go in
<tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kpanel/pics/</tt>.
To completely remove a Theme, you may need to delete the contents
of these directories.

</itemize>


Clicking on <bf>OK</bf> will also apply the selected  Theme package, and
then close the Theme Manager.

If you click on the <bf>Extract</bf> button,
the contents of the highlighted Theme package will be extracted into
the  Work directory <em>without</em>  being
applied to the desktop.   This is useful if you are building a modified
Theme package.  If the Theme package is global, 
a local copy will also be added to your  personal
Themes directory.


The  list of available Themes can be modified as follows:
<itemize>
<item> Click on <bf>New</bf> to create a new entry in the list.
This cretes an  empty subdirectory for the new Theme in the
local Work directory.

 
<item> Click on <bf>Remove</bf> to delete a local Theme.
(This button is inactive when the highlighted Theme is a global
Theme.) 

<item> Click on <bf>Import</bf> to import a Theme package into your
local Themes directory.

<item> Click on <bf>Export</bf> to export the highlighted Theme package.

</itemize>


<sect> Theme package contents
<p>
This screen lists the elements contained in the selected Theme package.
and allows their selective installation to replace the 
corresponding elements
of the Theme that is currently being used.


If the checkbox <bf>Uninstall parts of previous theme</bf> is
selected,  the  previous theme files in the KDE configuration
directories will be backed up with a 
<tt>~</tt>  extension;  if the box is not checked, they
will be overwritten.  


A list of the possible elements of the Theme package is presented
(Colors, Wallpapers, Panel, ... etc.).   Each has a checkbox next to it,
and is identified as <bf>available</bf> or <bf>empty</bf>,
depending on whether or not this element is present
in  the  highlighted theme package listed on the previous (Installer) screen.
(Some Theme packages only contain a subset of the possible Theme elements.)

If they are listed as <bf>available</bf>, 
the checked  items in this list of possible Theme elements will
be installed into the appropriate
KDE configuration directories when the <bf>Apply</bf> button is clicked.
If items are left unchecked, the corresponding elements of the 
currently-running Theme package will be left unchanged when the <bf>Apply</bf>
button is clicked.



The <bf>Clear</bf> button clears all the checkboxes for the list of
Theme elements, and the <bf>Invert</bf>  exchanges checked and
unchecked items.
