<P>The <B>Contents</B> screen presents a list of the components 
contained in the selected 
Theme package.
It also allows you to choose which of these
components to install.
<P>
<P>Not all possible components are
necessarily present in a given
Theme package.
Components that are present are
listed as ``<B>available</B>'';
missing components are listed as <B>``empty''</B>.
<P>The checkbox ``<B>Uninstall parts of previous theme</B>'' determines
how missing components are handled when a Theme package is installed:
<UL>
<LI> If the box is <B>not</B> checked, those components of the
previously-installed Theme which are not supplied by the new
Theme package are left in place.</LI>
<LI> If the box is checked, all components of the previous
Theme are removed.</LI>
</UL>

If you wish to remove all Theme components by installing the
``Default''  Theme (a themeless Desktop), this box must be checked.
(The Default theme has <B>no</B> Theme components.)
<P>
<P>Each Theme component also has a checkbox next to it.
If the box next to a component listed  as ``<B>available</B>''
is checked, that component will be installed when the
<B>Apply</B> or <B>OK</B> button is clicked.
Components with unchecked boxes will not be installed.
<P>
<P>The <B>Clear</B> button clears all the checkboxes for the list of
Theme components, and the <B>Invert</B> button  exchanges checked and
unchecked items.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Note: the image files for the Window Titlebar and Window Border
components are installed into the directory
<CODE>~/.kde/share/apps/kwm/pics/</CODE>
and Panel image files go in
<CODE>~/.kde/share/apps/kpanel/pics/</CODE>.
If you find you are unable to 
completely remove a Theme to restore the
default desktop,  
delete the contents
of these directories.
