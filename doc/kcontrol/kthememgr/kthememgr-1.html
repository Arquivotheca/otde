<H3><A NAME="s1">1. KDE Theme Manager: Installer</A></H3>

<P>The KDE Theme Manager <B>Installer</B>
screen allows you to select the desktop <B>Theme</B>
package you wish to install. 
<P>Installation of a <B>Theme</B> package customizes the appearance
of your desktop by modifying
some or all of the following: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Colors and Wallpapers, 
panel appearance,
sounds associated with events,
standard icons,
window appearance (borders, titlebar, buttons), etc.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The column on the left lists the available  <B>Theme</B> packages.
The packages shown are either <EM>global themes</EM>
in the system Themes directory
<CODE>$KDEDIR/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</CODE>  or
<EM>local themes</EM> in your personal
Themes directory <CODE>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes</CODE>.
The packages can either be <CODE>tar</CODE> archives
compressed with <CODE>gzip</CODE>, or unpacked directories.
<P>The ``Default'' Theme is the plain (themeless) KDE Desktop.
<P>Click on a listed Theme to select it; its name will be
highlighted and  a picture  showing its  components
will be displayed in the central  box.   Information
about the Theme will be displayed in the lower  box. 
<P>Clicking on  <B>Default</B> will select the 
``Default'' Theme.
<P>When you select a Theme package
its contents will be extracted  and placed in your Theme Manager
Work directory <CODE>~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Work</CODE>.
(The previous contents of this directory will be deleted.)
<P>After selecting a Theme,
go to the next screen (<B>Contents</B>) to
choose which  components of the Theme package to
install.  When you have made your choice, click on <B>Apply</B>
to install the  selected components, which will be copied from
your Theme Manager Work directory.
<P>To quit the Theme Manager, click on <B>OK</B> to
apply the current Theme selection and then exit, or
click on <B>Cancel</B> to exit without installing
a new Theme.
<P>
<P>
<P>Theme packages can be imported, exported, created, or deleted
using the buttons
at the right:
<UL>
<LI> Click on ``<B>Add</B>'' to import a new theme package into your
local Themes directory.  You will be prompted for the name and
location
of the package.
</LI>
<LI> Click on ``<B>Save as</B>'' to export the contents
of your local Theme Manager Work directory as a new theme
package. 
You will be prompted for the location at  which to save it
(as a compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> archive).


</LI>
<LI> Click on ``<B>Create</B>'' to create a new entry in the list.
This creates a new Theme package in the local Theme Manager Work directory.  
It will initially be a copy of the currently-installed Theme package; 
you can then modify it as desired.


 </LI>
<LI> Click on ``<B>Remove</B>'' to delete a local Theme.
(This button is inactive when a global Theme is highlighted.)
