<sect>Configuring the Keyboard
<p>
Keyboard settings are features of the X server
which attempt to make good use of the available hardware. However,
it isn't always possible for the X server to actually supply all
the functions. For example, on some systems the key click is enabled
or disabled in the CMOS setup and the X server cannot supply an
alternative. Thus, if a setting doesn't seem to do anything, it is 
is because the X server and/or the hardware do not support anything 
better.

<p>
Users can adjust the following settings for the keyboard:

<itemize>
<item>enable/disable autorepeat
<item>key click volume
</itemize>

<sect>Configuring the Mouse

<p>
Users can adjust the following settings for the bell:

<itemize>
<item>accelerated movement rate
<item>threshold for accelerated movement
<item>button mapping
</itemize>

<p>
The threshold gives the distance the pointer must move (in a small
amount of time) before accelerated movement occurs. In this mode,
the pointer moves some factor faster than normal, relative to the
amount the user actually moves the pointing device. The factor
is the accelerated movement rate. These settings allow for slow, 
precise pointer motion over small distances and rapid motion across 
the screen with a short but quick motion. Large acceleration
values and small threshold values may make the pointer too jumpy
to be useful, as it will always move very quickly.
<p>

The button mapping will, if switched to left-handed, swap the meaning of the
mouse buttons.
