<h2>
Configuring the bell
</h2>

<p>
The system bell or <em>beep</em> is a feature of the X server,
which attempts to make good use of the available hardware. However,
it isn't always possible for the X server to actually make a beep
sound with exactly the parameters selected due to hardware
limitations. For example, on most PCs, volume control is not very
good so the X server seems to <em>fake</em> low volume with a
reduced duration of the sound. Thus, if the settings don't seem 
to do anything, this is because the X server and/or the hardware
don't support anything better.

<p>
User's are able to set the following parameters for the bell:

<ul>
<li>volume (percentage of "maximum" volume)
<li>pitch (in Hz)
<li>duration (in milliseconds)
</ul>

<p>
In order to make the settings persist from one X session to another,
the command "kcc -init" must be run (usually from the .xinitrc file).
The old method (~/Desktop/Autostart/bell_setup.sh) is no longer
needed and that shell script should be deleted.
