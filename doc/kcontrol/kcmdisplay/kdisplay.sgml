<sect>Introduction
<p>

KDisplay is a display setup utility. Running <verb> kcmdisplay  </verb>
gives a tab dialog with five pages dealing with different aspects of the
desktop display.

<enum>
<item>The desktop <bf>Background</bf>.
<item>The <bf>Screen Saver</bf>.
<item>The desktop <bf>Color Scheme</bf>.
<item>The desktop <bf>Fonts</bf>.
<item>The desktop <bf>Style</bf> choices.
</enum>

Running <verb>kcmdisplay -init</verb> simply applies your preferences to the
desktop.

<sect>Background
<p>

The Background setup dialog is comprised of four sections:

<enum>
<item>Desktop selection and <bf>Name</bf>.
<item>The background <bf>Preview Monitor</bf>.
<item>The background <bf>Color</bf>.
<item>The background <bf>Wallpaper</bf>.
</enum>

At the bottom of the screen the
selection <bf>Dock into the panel</bf>
allows you to select whether an icon for
the Background  Display Setting dialog is docked into the Panel
(this provides quick access to the Display Settings menu,
and also allows stepping through changing background
sequences  when the "<bf>Random</bf>" background mode
is selected).

Also at the bottom of the screen is a slider
allowing the  memory <bf>Cache size</bf> used by the display to
be adjusted.


<sect1>Name
<p>
The top left <bf>Desktop</bf> box lists the 
currently-configured desktops by their assigned names.
Click on a name to select the corresponding desktop to
be configured.   Click on <bf>Rename</bf> to change
the assigned name which appears on the Panel's desktop
selection buttons.

If you wish to configure a common background for
all Desktops, make  the <bf>Common Background</bf>
selection.

<sect1>Preview Monitor

<p>

This is a minature representation of your display background, using the
current settings.  To apply these settings to your display, press the
<bf>Apply</bf> button to continue using the KDE display setup utility, or the
<bf>Ok</bf> button to apply your changes and quit.

<p>

<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.

<sect1>Background Color

<p>

The display background can be filled with a single color or with a color
gradient.

<p>

Click the <bf>One Color</bf> button to fill the background with a single color.
The background color can be changed by clicking on the colored box which
shows the currently-selected color.
This will display a color selection dialog from which
you may select a new background color.

<p>

When you are happy with your color selection, press <bf>Ok</bf> in the color
selection dialog.  The color will be updated in the colored
box (and in the Preview
Monitor,  provided no Wallpaper is selected).
<p>

To fill the background with a color gradient or pattern,
click the <bf>Two Color</bf>
button. A second colored box will appear. 
Click on this box to select the second color.
Now click on the <bf>Setup</bf> button to choose how to
blend the two colors. A dialog and Preview box will appear.
You may choose to progressively blend the colors from 
<bf>top to bottom</bf> of the screen, from <bf>right to left</bf>, 
or in a <bf>pattern</bf> selected
from the list shown.   You will see a preview of the choice you make
before you apply it. Click <bf>OK</bf> or <bf>Cancel</bf> to leave
this dialog.

<p>
A blend of the two colors uses only 8 colors, leaving plenty free for other
applications. However, it requires an image the size of your display to be
maintained in memory.

<sect1>Wallpaper

<p>

The wallpaper is an image displayed in the background (root window) of your
display.  To change the wallpaper displayed, select one from the list
or click the <bf>Browse</bf> button and select an image.  If wish to
use a One Color or Two Color background, choose <tt>No Wallpaper</tt>. 

<p>
Choose from the <bf>Arrangement</bf> list to select how the
wallpaper image is applied to the desktop: various tiling, mirroring, or
scaling schemes are possible, and their effects may be seen in 
the Preview box.

<p>
You may also select <bf>Random</bf> which causes a random sequence
of backgrounds to be displayed, changing after a specified time
interval.  Click on the <bf>Setup</bf> button to select 
the sequence of backgrounds that are chosen from.  The sequence
will be sampled randomly, unless you make the selection
that the sequence is sampled <bf>in order</bf>.
The <bf>Timer Delay</bf> box allows you to set
the interval in seconds between changes.  If the icon for the
background display settings is docked in the Panel, and <bf>Random</bf> is
selected, you can click on the icon to cause the next scheduled background
change to occur immediately.


If the option <bf>Pick files from directory</bf> is
selected, the backgrounds wil be
chosen from the set of wallpaper files in the selected directory
entered in the box that opens.
If this option is <bf>not</bf> selected, they will
be chosen from a <bf>user-created sequence</bf>  of backgrounds listed in
the main box.

<itemize>
<item>
To add an entry to this <bf>user-created sequence</bf>, 
click on <bf>Add</bf>; this will add
a highlighted  <tt>No Wallpaper</tt> entry for the 
currently-selected Color background 
from the main Background <bf>Display settings</bf> screen to the sequence.
Click on an item in the sequence to highlight it.
To replace  this
highlighted entry, go back to the main Background
<bf>Display settings</bf> screen 
(without closing the <bf>Random mode setup</bf> screen)
and deselect <bf>Random</bf>.
Whatever <bf>Wallpaper</bf> (including
<tt>No Wallpaper</tt>) you now select will replace the highlighted
entry in the Random Mode background sequence.
Click on <bf>Delete</bf> to remove the highlighted
item from the Random Mode backgrounds sequence.
In this way, you can construct any sequence of backgrounds
you wish.  Click on <bf>OK</bf> when you are satisfied with it.
Don't forget to reselect <bf>Random</bf> in the main Background
Display Setting screen to activate your Random Mode backgrounds.
</itemize>

<p>
Displaying wallpaper requires that the image be kept in memory.  If you are low
on memory, using a small, tiled image or none at all is recommended. Note
that scaling or centering a small image still requires an image the size of
your display to be maintained in memory.

<sect>Screen Saver
<p>

The Screen Saver setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The screen saver <bf>Preview Monitor</bf>.
<item>The global screen saver <bf>Settings</bf>.
<item>The  choice of <bf>Screen Saver</bf> program to run.


</enum>

<sect1>Preview Monitor
<p>

This is a minature representation of your screen saver, using the current
settings.  
To apply these settings to your display, press the <bf>Apply</bf>
button to continue using the KDE display setup utility or <bf>Ok</bf> button
to apply your changes and quit.

<p>

In the corners of this monitor are four grey boxes.  These boxes indicate
what action to take if the cursor is left in one of the corners for more than
5 seconds.  The options are:

<itemize>
<item>Ignore - take no action
<item>Save - invoke the screen saver
<item>Lock - lock the screen
</itemize>

To select an option, place the mouse over a grey box, and right-click;
make your choice in the dialog box that opens. If the Save or Lock
option is selected, this
is shown in the corresponding grey box: ("s" = Save, "l" = Lock). 


<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.

<sect1>Settings
<p>

Enter the time (in minutes) without activity to wait before the screen saver
is invoked.

<p>

Checking <bf>Requires Password</bf> will make the screen saver prompt you for
your password before restoring the screen.
<p>
Check <bf>Show password as stars</bf> for the screensaver password box
to show the number of characters typed.


<p>

<bf>Priority</bf> sets the priority 
of the screen saver (the "nice" value of its process)
relative to other running processes.

<sect1>Screen Saver
<p>

Choose the particular screen saver program that runs from the list.  
The working screen saver will
be shown in minature in the preview monitor.
(<tt>No screensaver</tt> is the default.)
<p>

Most screen savers have settings which can be changed by clicking the
<bf>Setup...</bf> button.  This will display a dialog specific to the
currently selected screen saver.

<p>

The <bf>Test</bf> button runs the screen saver immediately, full screen,
for a short interval.

<sect>Color Scheme
<p>

The Color Scheme setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The color scheme <bf>Preview</bf>.
<item>The current <bf>Widget Color</bf>.
<item>The available <bf>Color Schemes</bf>.
</enum>

(A "<bf>Widget</bf>" is a commonly-used programmer's term for referring to
User Interface elements such as buttons, menus, and scroll bars )

<sect1>Preview
<p>

This section of the dialog demonstrates how a color scheme applies to a
sample selection of widgets. A color scheme consists of a set of ten
colors. These colors apply to the :-

<enum>
<item>Inactive title bar background
<item>Inactive title bar text
<item>Active title bar background
<item>Active title bar text
<item>General background
<item>General foreground
<item>Selection background
<item>Selection text
<item>Window background
<item>Window text
</enum>

Labels on the sample widgets will help you identify where these colors apply.

<p>

The colors are grouped into 5 foreground / background pairs. Thus, good
contrast between the foreground and background colors of widgets can be
ensured at all times.

<p>

When you press <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> the color scheme you have selected
will be written to the desktop configuration.  

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.

<p>
There are some problems in
the Qt toolkit when changing the colors in a running application, particularly
with lists and combo boxes.  These elements will not be displayed properly
until the applications are restarted.  Hopefully these problems will be
fixed in a future release of Qt.




<sect1>Widget Color
<p>

The currently selected member of the color scheme is shown in the combo box
of the <bf>Widget Color</bf> group. This can be changed by clicking on the
colored box. A color selection dialog will then appear, from which you may
select a new color.
You may select any member of the color scheme from the 
color combination box.
<p>

When you are happy with your color selection, press <bf>Ok</bf> in the color
selection dialog.  The color will be updated in the <bf>Preview</bf>.

<p>
<p>
The <bf>Contrast</bf> slider allows you to change the contrast bewteen
different shadings of the selected colors.





<sect1>Color schemes
<p>

Various color schemes are supplied with KDisplay. These include:
KDE default, 
Atlas green
BeOS,
Blue slate,
CDE,
Desert red,
Digital CDE,
Pale gray,
Pumpkin,
Solaris CDE,
Storm,
and Windows 95.
To preview a scheme click on its name in the list box. 

<p>
You can use the
KDE-supplied Color Schemes as a starting point to devise your own
Scheme. Click on the 
<bf>Add</bf> button to store the color scheme from the
Preview under a new name, then modify it. When such a user-created
Color Scheme is selected, changes to it (as shown
in the Preview) can be  saved
with the <bf>Save Changes</bf> button; it can also be
deleted with the 
<bf>Remove</bf> button.

The KDE-supplied Schemes themselves cannot be changed or deleted.

<!-- NEW SECTION	NEW SECTION		NEW SECTION		NEW SECTION		 -->

<sect>Fonts
<p>

You may change the font and character set  for the desktop.  
These fonts will be used by KDE applications, and (depending on
the choice in the <bf>Style</bf> settings) by selected non-KDE
applications.

(This option has only recently been
enabled in all KDE applications, therefore some applications may not behave
correctly when their fonts are changed, or if a large font is used, and 
you may have to restart KDE for the changes to take effect.)

Click on a Font category in the main list to select it
(This lists various categories of KDE functions for which
a font must be defined: General font, Fixed font, etc.). 

For each category,
select a <bf>Typeface</bf> from the list,
optionally choose <bf>Bold</bf> or <bf>Italic</bf>,  
and select the typeface size by clicking
on "+" or "-" buttons at the right of the <bf>Size</bf> box.
You may also choose the <bf>Character Set</bf> for this font (the choices
available depend on the Typeface chosen). The choices 
<tt>default</tt> 
and <tt>any</tt> are always available.
(The Default Character Set is configured in the File Manager Font menu).

The font you have selected is previewed in the 
<bf>Sample text</bf> box.


To restore the KDE default configuration, click on the <bf>Default</bf>
button at the bottom of the screen.  Click on <bf>Apply</bf> or
<bf>OK</bf> to activate your choice.  

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.


<sect>Style
<p>

The Style dialog allows three Desktop style choices to be made:

<itemize>
<item> <bf>Draw widgets in the  style of Windows 95</bf>.  This allows 
This allows you to switch between a Motif look or a Windows 95 look for the K
Desktop Environment.  For example, the widget that lets these
choices be made is a button in Motif style, and a check box in
Windows 95 style.

<item> <bf>Menubar on top of the screen in the style of MacOS</bf>.
This selection emulates the MacOS style by placing a menubar for
the currently-active application at the top of the screen.
 

<item> <bf>Apply fonts and colors to non-KDE apps</bf>.
Selecting this option allows the "look and feel"
of KDE applications (mainly fonts and colors) to also be applied to 
certain non-KDE X11 applications such as Emacs and XEmacs.  
This feature uses <tt>krdb</tt>, KDE's
interface to <tt>xrdb</tt>, the X-resources database.  If this
causes you to experience problems with your non-KDE applications, 
you should make sure that the Desktop
Font settings (especially the Fixed font for emacs) are correctly set
(you may need to change these settings at least once so entries in your
<tt>~/.kderc</tt> file are generated).   Changes you make, including
de-activating this selection, may not take effect until KDE is
restarted.

</itemize>

<p>
To restore the KDE default configuration, click on the <bf>Default</bf>
button at the bottom of the screen.  Click on <bf>Apply</bf> or
<bf>OK</bf> to activate your choice.  

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.
