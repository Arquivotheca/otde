<h1>KDE Display Setup: General</h1>

The General setup dialog is comprised of two sections:

<ul>
<li>1. The <b>Widget style</b> box.
<li>2. The <b>Fonts</b> selection dialog.
</ul>

<h2>Widget Style</h2>

This allows you to switch between a Motif look or a Windows 95 look for the K
Desktop Environment.  Currently, Qt does not adjust combo boxes properly when
the widget style is changed.

<h2>Fonts</h2>

You may change the font for the desktop.  This option has only recently been
enabled in all KDE applications, therefore some applications may not behave
correctly when their fonts are changed, or if a large font is used.

<h2>Charset</h2>

You may change the charset. This option has only recently been
enabled in all KDE applications, therefore some applications may not behave
correctly when their charset is changed.
