<h1>KDE Display Setup: Background</h1>

The Background setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<ul>
<li>1. The background <b>Preview Monitor</b>.
<li>2. The background <b>Color</b>.
<li>3. The background <b>Wallpaper</b>.
</ul>

<h2>Preview Monitor</h2>

This is a minature representation of your display background, using the
current settings.  To apply these settings to your display, press the
<i>Apply</i> button to continue using the KDE display setup
utility, or the <i>Ok</i> button to apply your changes and quit.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Pressing <i>Ok</i> or <i>Apply</i> applies changes made in
all of the display setup modules.

<h2>Background Color</h2>

The display background can be filled with a single color or with a color
gradient.

<p>

Click the <i>Flat</i> button to fill the background with a single color. The
background color can be changed by clicking on the colored box in the
<b>Color</b> group.  This will display a color selection dialog from which
you may select a background color.

<p>

When you are happy with your color selection, press <i>Ok</i> in the color
selection dialog.  The color will be updated in the <b>Preview Monitor</b>.  If you
have a wallpaper selected, you may not see the background color, as the
wallpaper will cover it.

<p>

To fill the background with a color gradient click the <i>Gradient</i>
button. A second colored box will appear. The color gradient will run between
the colors shown in the two boxes. The gradient runs up and down the
display if  the <i>Portrait</i> option is selected. Alternatively, if the
<i>Landscape</i> option is selected, the color gradient will run across the
display.

<p>

You will not see the wallpaper when you choose a color gradient fill.

<p>

A gradient fill uses only 8 colors leaving plenty free for other
applications. However, it requires an image the size of your display to
be maintained in memory.

<h2>Wallpaper</h2>

The wallpaper is an image displayed in the background (root window) of your
display.  To change the wallpaper displayed, type in the filename of the
image, or click the <i>Browse</i> button and select an image.

<p>

The image may be: <i>Tiled</i>, <i>Centred</i>, or <i>Scaled</i> to fit the
size of the display.

<p>

Displaying wallpaper requires that the image be kept memory.  If you are
low on memory, using a small, tiled image or none at all is recommended.
Note that scaling or centring a small image still requires an image the size
of your display to be maintained in memory.
