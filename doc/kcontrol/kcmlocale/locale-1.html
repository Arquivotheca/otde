<P>
<P>With this dialog, you can set the language that is used by KDE. You can
choose up to three languages. If you start a programm, KDE tries to find a
translation of the programs texts into the first language. If this failes,
it looks for the second, then for the third. If all three tests fail, the
default language is used. This is usually English.
<P>
<P>The search for up to three languages allows to set preferences. You might
want to have the output in Spanish, but if this fails, you might prefer
French to German or English, so you can set the 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>First language to <CODE>Spanish</CODE></LI>
<LI>Second language to <CODE>French</CODE></LI>
<LI>Third language to <CODE>German</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>In an ideal world, all programs would be translated to all languages, but in
reallity this will take some more time :-(
<P>Setting or changing the languages will not affect the programs that are
already running. Only programs started after the change will be translated
accordingly. To change the language for all programs on the screen, you will
have to log out first, then log in again.
