<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</H2>

<P><TT>KDE System Sounds </TT>allows you to assign sounds to various
sytem events. When such an event (like "Window open") occurs, the
sound file that has been associated to that sound file will be played
back. 
</p>

<p>
Currently only WAV files are supported by the KDE System Sound
Module. By default these WAV files must be located in the directory
$(KDEDIR)/share/sounds. To assign other sound files to system events,
just drag them from a <tt>kfm</tt> window onto the sound list.

<P>Version 0.0.3 (Christian Czezatke)</P>
<pre>
Version 0.0.3 (Nov. 22nd, 1997)

- uses KApplication::localconfigdir()

- fixed a bug that messed up the assignments of system sounds to 
  events in some cases when WAV files were dropped on the sound list

- initial help page written

- german nationalisation added. (email me if you want to add
  antother language to syssound).

- syssounds is now based on kexample-0.5.1. This and the move to
  the kcontrol interface finally removed the compile problems

- prepared syssound.cpp for internationalisation (thanks
  to Matthias Hoelzer)

- Adapted syssound to the new kcontrol interface that replaces
  kcc now, so syssound works with the current kde snapshots
  now. (thanks to Matthias Hoelzer)

Version 0.0.2 (Oct. 21st, 1997)

- Moved README from "syssound/syssound" to "syssound"
  and updated it a bit.

- Moved the file "COMPILING.TXT" from "syssound/syssound"
  to "syssound".

- Made the placement of the configuration file compliant
  with the new KDE convention. The sound configuration 
  is now stored in $HOME/.kde/share/config/kwmsoundrc

- Brushed up the look of the config dialog a bit. It
  now supports keyboard accelerators and has 
  labels for the listboxes.

- Added support for Droping WAV Files onto the WAV
  Filelist (currently, only file:/ URLs are supported,
  .WAV Files are recognized by the extension ".wav"
  (in small letters).

- Sound configuration now works with KDE Beta1 too
  (no more "pure virtual function called" or
  "only root can run this module" error messages.

Version 0.0.1 (initial release)
