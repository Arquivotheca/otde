<sect>Introduction

<p>
KDE <bf>System Sounds</bf> allows you to assign sounds to various
system events. When such an event (like "Window open") occurs, the
sound file that has been associated to that sound will be played.

<p>
Currently, only WAV files are supported by the KDE System Sound
Module. By default, these WAV files must be in the directory
$(KDEDIR)/share/sounds. To assign other sound files to system events,
just drag them from a <tt>kfm</tt> window onto the sound list.

<p>
Version 0.0.3 (Nov. 22nd, 1997)

- uses KApplication::localconfigdir()

- fixed a bug that messed up the assignments of system sounds to 
  events in some cases when WAV files were dropped on the sound list

- initial help page written

- german nationalisation added. (email me if you want to add
  antother language to syssound).

- syssounds is now based on kexample-0.5.1. This and the move to
  the kcontrol interface finally removed the compile problems

- prepared syssound.cpp for internationalisation (thanks
  to Matthias Hoelzer)

- Adapted syssound to the new kcontrol interface that replaces
  kcc now, so syssound works with the current kde snapshots
  now. (thanks to Matthias Hoelzer)

Version 0.0.2 (Oct. 21st, 1997)

- Moved README from "syssound/syssound" to "syssound"
  and updated it a bit.

- Moved the file "COMPILING.TXT" from "syssound/syssound"
  to "syssound".

- Made the placement of the configuration file compliant
  with the new KDE convention. The sound configuration 
  is now stored in $HOME/.kde/share/config/kwmsoundrc

- Brushed up the look of the config dialog a bit. It
  now supports keyboard accelerators and has 
  labels for the listboxes.

- Added support for Droping WAV Files onto the WAV
  Filelist (currently, only file:/ URLs are supported,
  .WAV Files are recognized by the extension ".wav"
  (in small letters).

- Sound configuration now works with KDE Beta1 too
  (no more "pure virtual function called" or
  "only root can run this module" error messages.

Version 0.0.1 (initial release)
