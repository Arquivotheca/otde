<sect> KFM Configuration: Fonts
<p>
In this screen, you can customize the Fonts
used by the File Manager and other KDE applications.

<itemize>
<item>The "<bf>Font Size</bf> button selects between
Small/Medium/Large Font sizes.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Standard Font</bf>" list allows the
standard (proportional spacing) font to be chosen.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Fixed Font</bf>" list allows the
font for displaying text with fixed spacing  to be chosen.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Default Charset</bf>" list allows the
default character set  for displaying text to be chosen.
If "<bf>Use Language Charset</bf>" is chosen, no default character
set will be selected, and the character set appropriate
for your Language setting will be used.
</itemize>



<sect> KFM Configuration: Color
<p>
In this screen you can customize the File Manager
color settings.  When you click on a color box, the "Select
Color"screen allows you to select a color for the corresponding
item.

<itemize>
<item> "<bf>Background Color</bf>" 
is the color of the background
in a File Manager window.

<item> "<bf>Normal Text Color</bf>
is the color used for displaying normal 
test (i.e., text without hypertext links) 
within a hypertext document viewed with
the KDE File Manager and Browser, KFM.

<item> "<bf>URL Link Color</bf>" is the color
in which text with clickable hypertext URL links is
shown on pages viewed with the KDE File Manager 
and Browser (KFM),
<it>before</it> the link is followed.
Directory entries viewed with KFM are also
URL links.

<item> "<bf>Followed  Link Color</bf>" is the color
in which clickable  links are shown, <it>after</it> the
link has been followed, during the period that this
event is remembered.
</itemize>

Two further buttons control how links are displayed:

<itemize>
<item>If "<bf>Change cursor over link</bf>" is selected, the cursor
changes from an arrow to a pointing hand when it is
over a clickable link.

<item>If "<bf>Underline links</bf>" is selected, clickable
links are underlined.

</itemize>

<sect> KFM File Manager Configuration: Other
<p>
<itemize>
<item> "<bf>Allow per-URL settings</bf>"
means allow to save settings (whether menubar, toolbar, statusbar, and URL are
shown or hidden, the window size, all the options from the 'View' menu, ...)
as settings for a given URL. This can be, for example, any directory on your
disk where you have write access, or any URL (directory or even Web URL) which
has a shortcut on your desktop or which you have bookmarked.

<item> If "<bf>Tree view follows navigation</bf>" is selected, the tree view
(the one on the left when it is enabled) will open the directories you enter in 
the right view. However, it will never close them by itself, so that you can go 
in a previous directory easily, by finding it in the tree.

</itemize>  
In the "<bf>terminal</bf>" box, you can type the command that
will be  executed to provide a terminal whenever you select
"Open Terminal" in the File Manager "File" menu, and when an application is
about to be run in a terminal by the file manager.
The default terminal application is <tt>konsole</tt>.

<sect> KFM Web Browser Configuration: User Agent
<p>

In this screen, you can configure the
<bf>User-Agent String</bf>, which is what the
KFM Browser reports as its name and version to web servers,
when requesting web pages.

This name can be configured to be specific for a given
web site.    

The usefulness of this is that webservers may decide
on what form to send the information (i.e., frames or
no frames) depending of which browser application it
thinks it is talking to.  

Rumor also has it that certain
browser distributors' sites have in the past been 
programmed to send error messages when the the User-Agent
String of a competing browser application is reported
to them!


The KFM Browser is perfectly capable of handling frames,
but this  may not be known to a web site that only sends frames
to browsers it thinks can handle them.  In such a case,
you can configure KFM so that for that particular site,
it reports the User-Agent String of another well-known browser such
as <bf>Netscape Navigator</bf> (tm), 
which has user-agent string "<bf>Mozilla</bf>", plus version information,
or <bf>Interner Explorer</bf>(tm).


The default User-Agent string for KFM is set to <bf>Konqueror</bf>
plus version information
(a conqueror of course being the next one in the
sequence navigator - explorer - * )!

<sect> KFM Configuration: Desktop Icons
<p>
In this screen, you can control the default spacing of the icons
on your KDE desktop, and how their names are displayed.

<itemize>
<item> Specify the "<bf>Horizontal Root Grid Spacing</bf>" and
the  "<bf>Vertical Root Grid Spacing</bf>" to chose the hidden
grid on which the desktop icons will, by default,  be placed.

<item> The icon names appear as text below the icon. 
By default, the text appears on a small opaque rectangular
background that hides the Desktop wallpaper below. 
To remove this background, press the 
"<bf>Transparent Text for Desktop Icons</bf>"
button.

<item> Click on the "<bf>Icon foreground color</bf>" box to 
chose the color of the text giving the icon name.

<item> Click on the box "<bf>Icon background color</bf>" to 
chose the color of the background on  which the icon name is written.
(Inactive if "Transparent Text for Desktop Icons" is selected.)

</itemize>

Click on "<bf>Apply</bf>" to apply configuration changes to
your current desktop.   "<bf>OK</bf>" applies the changes and  exits,
while "<bf>Cancel</bf>" exits without applying the changes.
