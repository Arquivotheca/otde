<sect> KFM Configuration: Fonts
<p>
In this screen, you can customize the Fonts
used by the File Manager and other KDE applications.

<itemize>
<item>The "<bf>Font Size</bf> button selects between
Small/Medium/Large Font sizes.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Standard Font</bf>" list allows the
standard (proportional spacing) font to be chosen.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Fixed Font</bf>" list allows the
font for displaying text with fixed spacing  to be chosen.

<item>The pull-down "<bf>Default Charset</bf>" list allows the
default character set  for displaying text to be chosen.
If "<bf>Use Language Charset</bf>" is chosen, no default character
set will be selected, and the character set appropriate
for your Language setting will be used.
</itemize>



<sect> KFM Configuration: Color
<p>
In this screen you can customize the File Manager
color settings.  When you click on a color box, the "Select
Color"screen allows you to select a color for the corresponding
item.

<itemize>
<item> "<bf>Background Color</bf>" 
is the color of the background
in a File Manager window.

<item> "<bf>Normal Text Color</bf>
is the color used for displaying normal clickable hypertext
links for moving around within a hypertext document.

<item> "<bf>URL Link Color</bf>" is the color
in which clickable URL links (to local files, or
Internet addresses) are shown, <it>before</it> the
link is followed.

<item> "<bf>Followed  Link Color</bf>" is the color
in which clickable  links (both URL links, and
Normal Text links) are shown, <it>after</it> the
link has been followed.
</itemize>

Two further buttons control how links are displayed:

<itemize>
<item>If "<bf>Change cursor over link</bf>" is selected, the cursor
changes from an arrow to a pointing hand when it is
over a clickable link.

<item>If "<bf>Underline links</bf>" is selected, clickable
links are underlined.

</itemize>

<sect> KFM File Manager Configuration: Other
<p>
<itemize>
<item> "<bf>Allow per-URL settings</bf>"
means allow to save settings (whether menubar, toolbar, statusbar, and URL are
shown or hidden, the window size, all the options from the 'View' menu, ...)
as settings for a given URL. This can be, for example, any directory on your
disk where you have write access, or any URL (directory or even Web URL) which
has a shortcut on your desktop or which you have bookmarked.

<item> If "<bf>Tree view follows navigation</bf>" is selected, the tree view
(the one on the left when it is enabled) will open the directories you enter in 
the right view. However, it will never close them by itself, so that you can go 
in a previous directory easily, by finding it in the tree.

</itemize>  
In the "<bf>terminal</bf>" box, you can type the command that
will be  executed to provide a terminal whenever you select
"Open Terminal" in the File Manager "File" menu, and when an application is
about to be run in a terminal by the file manager.
The default terminal application is <tt>konsole</tt>.

<sect> KFM Web Browser Configuration: User Agent
<p>
What is the "UserAgent" string ?
Here is what Kalle Dalheimer said about it :

Some web servers send you different pages depending on which browser you
use. Every browser sends a so-called "UserAgent" string (e.g. for
Netscape, this string is "Mozilla" plus some version information), and
servers can evaluate this. For example, there was a time when the web
server serving www.microsoft.com returned pages with error messages on
purpose when you browsed the site with Netscape Navigator. Another
example: some webmasters tend to think that only Navigator and Internet
Exploder can handle frames, thus, they automatically send non-frame
versions to all other browsers, whether they can handle frames or not.
 
I have written this dialog (and Torben has integrated it into kfm) so
that you can determine yourself which UserAgent string kfm sends (the
default, as you can see, is "Konqueror" plus version information, a
conqueror of course being the next one in the row navigator-explorer-).
Unlike with other browsers, this dialog even allows you to set a certain
UserAgent string for a specific web site. Thus, you can tell the web
server at www.microsoft.com that you are an Internet Exploder, the web
server at www.netscape.com that you are a Navigator and all others that
you are a honest web browser :-)

<sect> KFM Configuration: Desktop Icons
<p>
In this screen, you can control the default spacing of the icons
on your KDE desktop, and how their names are displayed.

<itemize>
<item> Specify the "<bf>Horizontal Root Grid Spacing</bf>" and
the  "<bf>Vertical Root Grid Spacing</bf>" to chose the hidden
grid on which the desktop icons will, by default,  be placed.

<item> The icon names appear as text below the icon. 
By default, the text appears on a small opaque rectangular
background that hides the Desktop wallpaper below. 
To remove this background, press the 
"<bf>Transparent Text for Desktop Icons</bf>"
button.

<item> Click on the "<bf>Icon foreground color</bf>" box to 
chose the color of the text giving the icon name.

<item> Click on the box "<bf>Icon background color</bf>" to 
chose the color of the background on  which the icon name is written.
(Inactive if "Transparent Text for Desktop Icons" is selected.)

</itemize>

Click on "<bf>Apply</bf>" to apply configuration changes to
your current desktop.   "<bf>OK</bf>" applies the changes and  exits,
while "<bf>Cancel</bf>" exits without applying the changes.
