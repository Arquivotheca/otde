<P>
<P>``<B>Cookies</B>'' are little messages you receive from a 
remote website which are intended to be stored on your
system, and  sent
back by your browser to that site the next time you visit it 
(or when you visit
another page on the site). 
<P>Cookies can be used by websites to automatically
identify you for a longer period of time. A website can use this to store
your preferences. Cookies can also be used to track your behaviour
on a site. Used as such, some people consider cookies an attack on their
privacy. KFM offers you a broad range of possibilities to decide which cookies
you want to receive and which you don't.  
<P>If ``<B>Enable Cookies</B>'' is activated,  cookies will be accepted 
according to the following settings and
stored cookies will be sent.
If it is <B>not</B> activated, no cookie will ever be sent, 
and no new cookies will be accepted.
<P>The ``<B>default accept policy</B>'' setting
defines what to do with cookies which do not originate from
a domain which has a domain-specific setting. 
<UL>
<LI> "<B>Accept</B>" will accept all cookies received without 
notifying the user.</LI>
<LI> ``<B>Ask</B>'' will open a popup box to
ask the user what to do, each time
a cookie is received.</LI>
<LI> ``<B>Reject</B>'' will reject all cookies received without 
notifying the user.</LI>
</UL>
<P>You may set specific policies for  how to treat cookies received
from domains listed in the ``<B>Domain specific settings</B>'' box.
<P>To add such a domain, type its name in the 
``<B>change domain accept policy</B>'' box, and click on one of the
three policies (<B>accept/ask/reject</B>). Then click on 
``<B>change</B>'' to add the new entry to the list of domain-specific
settings.    To modify the entry for an exiting domain in the list,
click on it to highlight it, then set a new cookie acceptance policy for it, 
or click on <B>delete</B> to remove it.
<P>Cookies originating from one of these domains will be treated according to the
policy set for them. 
When you have selected ``<B>ask</B>'' for a domain you will get a 
popup window when
a cookie is received from this domain, which asks you what to do
with the cookie. This popup window can also be used to change the acceptance 
policy for the domain.
