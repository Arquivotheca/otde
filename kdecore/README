This is the second, still unofficial and probably still horribly buggy
and lousily written release of the kde core library, yet containing
nothing more but the KConfig class.

CHANGES
=======

see ../CHANGES


How to use the KConfig class
============================
These thoughts are by no means complete or decided on forever, feel free to
discuss them on the list.

- Create a KConfig object. If your application needs an
application-specific config file, pass a QTextStream* for this file.
- Read values with ReadEntry. The keys are searched in the following
files (sorted from least to highest priority):
	/etc/kderc
	/usr/lib/KDE/system.kderc
	/usr/local/lib/KDE/system.kderc
	~/.kderc
	application-specific config file if it exists
- Only keys that are in the current group will be found. After
constructing a KConfig object, the current group is "" aka "the
default group". You can set the group with SetGroup(). A group is
specified in a config file with the group name in brackets, the
left bracket must be in column 0.
- Write values with WriteEntry. WriteEntry only writes to memory; the
data is written to disk when you call Sync() explicitly or when you
destroy the KConfig object. The entries are always written to the most
specific writeable config file.


How to use the kconfigtest test program
=======================================
- (The test program has been moved to the test directory.)
- You can find information about the last operation in the info field
at the bottom of the window.
- Enter a key left to the "=" character and press enter. If there was
entry with this key in the current group, the corresponding value will
be shown in the field right to the "=".
- To change the current group, enter a new group name in the group
field and press enter. To return to the default group, just clear the
field and press enter again.
- To provide an application-specific config file, enter its name in
the edit field in the first line and press enter.
- If you have changed the group or app config fields, you have to to
the key field and press enter there in order to see the effects your
changes may have on the key search.
- To write an entry, enter the value in the value field right to the
"=" and press the write button.
- To quit the application, press the quit button (now, this was easy!)


Some proposals on where configuration entries should go
=======================================================
- Default, KDE-wide key bindings, colors, etc: This should not go in
any config file but be hard-coded, probably in the KApplication class.
- Site-wide configuration, e.g. mail server: one of the files KConfig
searches which are not below the user's home directory.
- User-defined values which are not application-specific: in ~/.kderc.
- User-defined, application-specific values: in some file specified by
the application. The exact name should be set by KApplication and
somehow be computed from argv[0] (or a value explicitly set by the
application programmer???).


Further questions
=================
Should "the default group" be what the name says (a group in which to
search for a key if it was not found in the specified group) or what
it is now (a group like all the others which just happens to have no
name)?
